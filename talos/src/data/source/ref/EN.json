She probably did not regard it as a powerful skill. When asked about her lack of eagerness to describe her Arts skills, she would reply with: \"I'm just ... not very good with the Arts... The sword is better. I might make a huge mess if I fool around with the Xiranite.\" \nRegarding the Xiranite she mentioned, Endfield investigators in the region described it as an experimental technology exclusively developed at Hongshan. Xiranite seemed to be a type of memory metal that could only be manipulated with the Originium Arts. Chen happened to have graduated from a Hongshan institution of higher learning that was the first to offer a course named <i>Basic Manipulation and Control of Xiranite</i>. \n\"Wha?!

Our rear was thrown into a temporary panic as vital signs of knights and warriors under the 7th flickered and disappeared from the map screen. \nLosing the 7th and the supplies would doom the entire northern front. \nThe young ensign named Azrila arrived at the Command Hall in ten minutes. She took her orders and silently studied the glowing map holograms presented by the sandbox. The ensign nodded without a word. \n\"Is she reliable?\" One of the knights asked their mentor on the elevated seat of command. The ensign looked too young. Making her the captain of the special relief team might be a responsibility that would break her. Giving the unbloodied squire the task of delivering the 7th was considered a grave risk. \nThe wizened veteran placed both of his gauntleted hands on the hilt of his sword. The heavy Steel Throne did not answer. Those in the hall heard his grave and ancient voice: \"She is the best amongst us.\" \n\nThe best of the Oathkeepers was charging through the frigid wilderness rain. A pale red dot flickered in the green grids of her comm device, followed by a scream that dissipated in the winds. She took the device from a surviving radio operator just an hour ago. \n\"Find them...\" the grievously injured operator gurgled before going unconscious. \nShe wiped away the rain from her face. A thick fog lingered around the cap of a distant mountain. \n\"It's right ahead of us, ma'am,\" Adjutant Nilla said. Azrila turned around. With the comm device in hand, Nilla pointed at the hills before them. \"We'll be facing a densepouring of Aggeloi.\" \nThe rains in the north never end. The Oathkeepers had twenty words for rain. \n\"And I still believe it's a trap,\" Nilla insisted. \n\"Do I have any other choice? Should I simply ignore the distress calls from the 5th?\" \n\"According to the intel we just received, the 7th is just a few klicks away—\" \n\"We're already too late for them.\"\nAzrila then elaborated her rationale: \"We have received 3 distress calls with barely 2 minutes between each. And then they've gone dark again for more than 30 minutes.\" \nNilla took a deep breath. \"I have faith in you, Azrila.\" \nThe battlefield was not a place for the right or wrong. It was a place where hard decisions must be made. \n\nThe battle raged for another half an hour. Azrila failed to save Nilla from the Aggeloid lair. An Aggelos rammed its horn through her broken corpse and dragged her along the ground as a human warrior would parade a war trophy. \nAzrila was almost overwhelmed by the carnage as she surveyed the terrible loss. Corpses of her fellow Oathkeepers and Aggeloi were strewn across the broken field. Death raked the wilderness with its rusty scythe and left weeping gashes of carnage on the land itself. The ensign did not know whose howling she heard. \nShe finally realized this was not a war. War is something that would eventually end. The cauldron of the north does not. </>",

Exploring the fine balance between practicality and aesthetics has always been the leading pursuits of Mieszko designers ever since we released the first products of our Personal Security series. And today is the very day when we witness our great leap in technology, creativity, and craftsmanship. They kept us all waiting for too long. In fact, they kept the entire Talos-II waiting for too long. \n\n\"Allow me to bring you ...

This means for non-professionals, personal security gear would only be good enough to scare an innocent neighbor or two. They cannot guarantee your safety in actual emergencies when lives are truly at risk. But Primal-XR introduces a brand new paradigm to the entire world! Primal-XR uses our smart verbal controls and AR technologies to give you tactical solutions against all kinds of terrible situations. Even if you are an absolute zero in combat, Primal-XR will take your hand and make you the hero of your family against Aggeloi and Landbreakers alike. \n\n\"Primal.

She returned the tome to its usual place, switched off the screen, and carefully stashed the data tapes. The time had come for the Vesperian Canticles of Silence. \n\nSister Alosis was suddenly interrupted by an inopportune knocking on her door. \"Apologies for disturbing you at this hour, Tomekeeper Alosis,\" Brother Jorg said as he entered her cell, closely followed by young Brother Floinn who kept his head bowed. \n\nThey were at the most secluded Tome Cluster of the Cabal of Tranquility. It was built over one of the Blight-devastated ruins of the ancient civilization. The ingenious Durin constructed this \"hive\" of countless hexagonal cells. The Tomekeeper's Alcove where Sister Alosis worked at was near the entrance of the entire Cluster. She kept vigil over the entire place for 7 whole years. \n\nBrother Jorg and Brother Floinn had traveled far to borrow several tomes on advanced algorithmics. Sister Alosis never denied such requests. She set down her rosaries, took the key, and led the two priests into the Tome Cluster. \n\n<i>Treatise on Logicometrics and Determinants Thereof</i>, <i>The Lingua and Truth</i>, <i>Hermeneutics of Thought</i>, <i>The Mental Treatise</i>... One cell after another was opened as the trio made their way deeper into the hive. The final door of the ancient ruins silently awaited them in the heart of the Tome Cluster. \n\n\"Tomekeeper Alosis, may we invoke thee to open the final door and bless us with a glimpse of Veritas of the most ancient days?\" \n\nSister Alosis shook her head. They had not earned the Veritan Permit to witness the answers that lay beyond the door. \n\n\"Then forgive us, Tomekeeper!\" A thud immediately followed. Intense pain shot out from the point of impact upon her brow. \n\nBrother Jorg was already gone when Sister Alosis finally came around. The shelves were a mess of torn tomes and data tapes. Brother Floinn sat by the half-opened door, his mind and spirit seemingly crumpled and defeated. \n\nSister Alosis closed the door and sighed. \n\nThe poor young initiate should had learned that the journey of seeking Veritas was far more important than witnessing it. The arduous path must be taken to grant the seeker mental faculties and strengths capable of bearing the immense weight of true knowledge. \n\nThe Cabal's adjudication for Brother Floinn was just. The exact same sentence was delivered to Sister Alosis years ago. As for Brother Jorg ... Sister Alosis was given the task of locating the rogue Cabalist. \n\nThe new Tomekeeper started his first day of work. Brother Floinn began by recording this line: \n\n<i>Stress that exceeds the strength limit of an object will result in the permanent fracturing or crumbling of the said object.</i> ",

Your people and everyone you love shall drown in the filth of your veins.\"</i> \n\nThese were written on the old memo. He thought about it for a while, took out his pen and paper, and started his own scribbles— \n\n\"Hardly anyone knows why Landbreakers would want to attack their own people. They used to be a rather cohesive organization led by a single leader... Though the LBs later splintered, such levels of hostility between the successor groups seem to lack a proper basis... The seething hatred so vividly reflected by these notes as well as the brutality personally inflicted upon LBs captured by the author of the said notes can only be described as ... horrifying and gruesome...\" \n\nHe paused, reflected upon his words, and felt rather displeased with his conclusions. His pen then started scrawling across the page once more. \n\n\"I attempted to identify a 'common cause' or 'consensus' in these hateful words. Perhaps the LBs committed a transgression that led to the current kill on sight mentality, or perhaps the LBs have started working on some malicious scheme that continues to this day... I have enjoyed my investigation of the secret truth behind LB history, both as my profession and as a personal pastime of mine. Unfortunately, the author of these notes was just a simple, homicidal brute. He hanged the entire family of his 'breaker-pal' over some petty division of loot.\"\n\nHe paused again briefly, and then continued his scrawls with greater focus and intensity. \n\n\"Personal hatred means little. These words provide nothing to my goal of advancing the <i>Security Act for Peace on Talos-II</i>. We must make the very concept of Landbreaking criminal in every law and an anathema to our definitions for civilization. Their presence must be removed from every community, organization, and faction, legal or otherwise. Landbreaking must end to make humanity safe again.\" \n\nThese words seem to lend him strength. His writings picked up speed and alacrity. \n\"Peripheral rot is a condition that plagues every civilization. This cancer is always there and can never be truly cleansed. However, we must demonstrate our firm resolve and initiate the strong measures to completely sterilize this malignant presence.\" \n\nHe then concluded his own writings with one final line. \n\n\"I spent thirty years of my life as a Landbreaker. You must have faith in my words.\"",

According to records, after the Terrans arrived at Talos-II, Endfield enjoyed a slow and steady growth thanks to support from Rhodes Island. The two companies remained close partners with the Endministrator at the head of Endfield. The young company then grew at tremendous paces and exerted significant influence amongst the pioneers and frontier settlers of Talos-II. \nPursuant to the Endfield-Rhodes Island partnership agreement, a number of Rhodes Island operators were given assignments at Endfield to help the latter perform various tasks. Employee compensation and other relevant expenses for these Rhodes Islanders were paid for by Endfield. Rhodes Island also offered Endfield support in pharmaceutical sciences and other technologies. \nThe Endministrator believed that Rhodes Island's contributions to combating Oripathy should never be forgotten. Rhodes Island also regarded Endfield as the bearer of their legacy and vision as the young company actively supported exploration and pioneering efforts in Talos-II. Both sides hope to jointly explore the new world and prosper as one.</> ",

It was with some hesitation that I decided to pen this reply. Do be aware that I will have difficulty contacting you via conventional comm devices once the convoy sets off. \n\nI understand your concerns and I'm very well aware of the sadness and disappointment experienced by your team. As your mentor, you must understand that my decision was nothing personal and must cater to the bigger picture. My opinions alone would not sway the strategies of our marketing department. The fact that your technical blueprints earned no small amount of approval is a testament to the outstanding performance of your designs. You should be confident about that. \n\nJust 2 months ago, I was shocked when engineers from the fringe tech department released a working example of a miniaturized centrifugal Originium generator. It shattered the theoretical limits of energy conversion ratios for such devices and would certainly usher in the next revolutionary change for the very foundations of power generation. Even I would have brushed it off as mere hypothetical fantasy just 12 months ago but the truth proved otherwise. I was trapped in a comfort zone that blinded me from the scientific advancements that was within our reach. \n\nSo, don't let this setback dishearten you or keep you from learning. You are young and your choices are many. Though conventional Originium power generation remains a field with great potential, science and technology are always changing. It is difficult to accept failure, especially after so many years of hard work. But remember that you are an engineer. Do not let emotions affect your objectivity. \n\nBased on my own experiences, there will be a protracted period of time before the new tech becomes fully adopted. Stories from the Age of Terra often describe noisy old engines with abysmal Originium energy conversion ratios. Despite their poor performance, these engines offered advantages that the latest generators could not hope to provide—reliability and ease of maintenance. The world still has a place for the legacy workhorses and it will be long until they are completely phased out. \n\nRegardless of what I've said, your product design remains an outstanding work of engineering. I have faith that you and your team will quickly find a new direction. \n\nI look forward to hearing more about your progress in the future.\n\nYour friend and mentor, \nWillem Sinclair ",

Although they failed to locate the legendary Ancient Land, the adventure they shared built a strong friendship. \nSeveral months later, a gift from the Fiannæ Circuit reached Snowshine after relaying through the hands of several scabhta. It was a piece of finely carved talisman imbued with Circuit blessings. The talisman was said to protect the wearer against all sorts of dangers. Several words were inscribed at the back of the token: May you be forever one step ahead of the storm. \nSnowshine treasured the talisman as it symbolized both her friendship with the Circuit sage and her brave determination in the face of danger. It was comparable to the worn copy of ancient prayers accidentally left behind in the Woods. Snowshine treated the keepsake as the fount of her strength during work. Every time she wore the talisman, she felt imbued with the blessings of the Circuit sages as well as their deep ties to the lands of everlasting snow. </>",

It's real simple and it'll explain why I insist on busting my way out of this hospital with this worn, rusty, Endfield-made lance with bits of dried blood stuck within the cracks of its shaft in my hands. You gotta trust me. Once you hear my tale, you'll understand my perspective and STOP treating me like a lunatic with a freakish fetish for this spear. You might even decide to release me from this jacket and wheelchair. \n\nAnd I swear it'll be a simple story. Promise. Four years ago, or 1522 days to be precise, 6 Valley IV security officers on a mission to rescue a family trapped in the wilderness ran into an Aggeloid ambush. There were 10 of them. Ten blasted buggerloids with zero sympathies for the living. The conclusion was simple. You probably guessed it right. \n\nOnly 2 lived to see the next sunrise. \n\nYeah. Just the 2 of them. The strongest officer no longer had a weapon. He was surrounded by the corpses of his entire team. The man stood before a crying child and stared down at a badly damaged buggerloid. Its deadly appendages were shattered, but the beast of rock could still charge and crush both the man and babe with its bulk. The officer thought hard... What could he do? He was without a weapon...\n\nBut the officer quickly found a solution, thanks to Endfield Industries. Endfield lances featured field-fitting modular components, so...\n\nHe took the spearhead from his captain, salvaged the essence module from ■■■■■■'s hands, acquired a third of the shaft from ■■■■■■'s broken bones, pulled out the second part of the shaft from ■■■■■■'s back, and pried out the final part of the shaft from his wife's very skull. \n\nThe officer emerged victorious with his new weapon. He took the child to Valley IV and the lance was passed on to...\n\n    Hold on. Why do you look as though you just figured something out? \n    Am I the survivor? Is that why I've named this weapon Chimeric Justice? \n    Was I that child? Am I doing my best to repay the act of heroism? \n\n    No.\n    You got it all wrong.\n    Take a good look at this lance. A standard Endfield product. \n    Good. Now take a good look at me. \n    I had nothing to do with the story. I came into this world as a sickly runt with many broken parts. \n\n    But...\n    My retina, my heart, my blood, and every fiber of my being are crying out... Listen to the howling souls that sacrificed themselves for humanity to survive! \n    I refuse to sit and rot at this place. \n    My destiny is to become the TRUE Chimeric Justice! ",

You stood vigils over the smelting furnaces for years. \n\nYou came to the south because you could no longer face the Aggeloid nightmares. But you feared of being called a deserter. That was why you changed your name and joined us as an arsenal engineer. You found this simpler life at Endfield worth living. You helped fellow Endfielders survive their battles. They were grateful and praised the weapons you designed. Your work was balanced and operated smoothly. Your designs incorporated years of actual combat experience. You read Endfield science and research and it probably made you think about things. If the Fort had these technologies, you might have stayed at that place. \n\nDespite your reputation as a cranky old man, the girl likes you a lot. You always had a story to tell, stories that her parents never talked about. Stories about heroes, how they lived, how they fought without a care of their lives, and how their sacrifices went unsung and unremembered. You even learned a thing or two from her, right? This seamless design feature ... would be an oddity at the place where you once served. \n\nThis was why you hesitated when the girl asked you to teach her how to swing a sword. At first, you thought of your dashing, youthful years. Fencing skills would help the girl better protect herself. But your mind changed. The girl had the entire Endfield arsenal as well as loving parents to support her. She did not need to know about fencing. You then convinced yourself that the girl needed no instructions from a deserter and ex-butcher who broke his oaths. The old road had been abandoned for years. No one should take it anymore. It calls for no one, and needs none. \n\nThus, you applied for divisional transfer. You wanted to leave the arsenal and force yourself back to field service—you believe you should be able to stomach the frontlines of Endfield Industries. \n\nPlease do not look at me like I'm some sort of a Sarkaz Djall mind-floggers. And no. I wasn't using any mind-reading instruments. \n\nI do have a message for you: Supervisor Perlica will not oppose any decision you make, but please, don't make the girl sad.",

The nutcase claimed that he desperately needed the weapon to push our frontiers further into the wildlands. Even if I were to successfully make this mother-of-all-guns, I balk at the idea of handing over this dangerous weapon of mass devastation to the frontiersfolk. \n\n......\n\nTheoretically speaking, the yield was ... feasible. My calculations placed it within achievable limits but the numbers look risky. I had to redesign the structure of the Arts unit but this would ... double the weight of the entire setup. \n\n......\n\nA powered eviscerator with a moving chain of cutting bits? Their demands are getting nuttier with every single day. Are they really going to smash an enemy's head with this Arts unit? Come to think about it, the current build does have enough room for a motor. Maybe I'll give it a shot. \n\n......\n\nThey pushed further into the front and Walther invited me for a field tour. To quote the man, he wanted to see what my works had \"achieved\". It would be nice if mister blightbrain could explain how my prototype vanished and how they failed to salvage anything. Not even a piece of scrap.\n\n......\n\nIt was a monumental sight that I'd remember for life. The Aggeloid conglomerate was as big as a mountain and its carcass blocked the entire valley. Walther told me how he remotely controlled the prototype to ram against the Aggelos and how the mounted power eviscerator created an opening on its crust. The explosive payload was then detonated with ... ground shattering effects. ",

People with such combinations tend to be less disposed towards \"friendliness\". \nYvonne would spend a great of time styling her horns and tail so that they would take on a color similar to her nail polish. She also personally modified her working outfit. You won't find another one like it in the market. Yvonne also wore an array of strange accoutrements on her clothing. She was rumored to have attended various academic conferences decked out in these accessories where she stood out of the crowd and none dared approach her. After joining Endfield, her attire stirred up quite a bit of talk amongst fellow Endfielders. A number of our colleagues even tried to study and emulate her style. I must confess that age is catching up on me because I fail to recognize this fashion fad. \nOne day, I heard fellow Endfielders at the cafeteria say: \"Yvonne isn't wearing any accessories.\" Amazed, I asked them about this and they told me that Yvonne's \"accessories\" served more than just decorative purposes. Her working outfit is filled with all sorts of portable devices. The semi-transparent pink was made out of a custom tech-fabric for added durability, strength, and a healthy resistance against Æther radiation. Yvonne's \"necklace\" and \"jewelry\" were in fact various measurement devices that she had modified into her preferred shapes and forms. \nThe \"nail varnish\" that Yvonne applied to her horns and tail was a special pigment whose color saturation would change with the levels of ambient Æther. This would help Yvonne monitor changes in the environment. The resulting appearance, according to the scientist, also provided a crucial function. She reportedly said that the outfit allowed her to exempt herself from many things. \nI found myself agreeing to many of Yvonne's points. Academia in the Civilization Band is stagnating. Young scientists and researchers are required to \"observe and familiarize themselves with the rules\" and find a clique to join just to secure resources for their projects. A genius like Yvonne didn't need to \"play these games\" but they would distract her nonetheless. An avant-garde outfit going against the flow just might save her the trouble. \nI tried doing so back in my younger days but my colleagues quickly reported me for being a creep and forced me to conform to the proper standards. Yvonne managed to make this her very own style. We can say this is another special skill of hers. \n—Yvonne's probation review. REVIEWER: Andre</>",

According to records, after the Terrans arrived at Talos-II, Endfield enjoyed a slow and steady growth thanks to support from Rhodes Island. The two companies remained close partners with the Endministrator at the head of Endfield. The young company then grew at tremendous paces and exerted significant influence amongst the pioneers and frontier settlers of Talos-II. \nPursuant to the Endfield-Rhodes Island partnership agreement, a number of Rhodes Island operators were given assignments at Endfield to help the latter perform various tasks. Employee compensation and other relevant expenses for these Rhodes Islanders were paid for by Endfield. Rhodes Island also offered Endfield support in pharmaceutical sciences and other technologies. \nThe Endministrator believed that Rhodes Island's contributions to combating Oripathy should never be forgotten. Rhodes Island also regarded Endfield as the bearer of their legacy and vision as the young company actively supported exploration and pioneering efforts in Talos-II. Both sides hope to jointly explore the new world and prosper as one.</> ",

We don't need a just arbitrator when we already have the most reliable judge of our products—the market itself! Sir, a man of your years and experience should have seen the great upheavals when the index figures fluctuated and the lines leaped up and down the charts... Oh! You and your grandfather actually visited the old Terran General Chamber of Commerce...? Wonderful! Truly wonderful childhood memories! I'll just skip the things you already know. You should be well aware that everything we see is the result of our efforts in quantifying \"virtues\" into actual value that we can trade with. \n\nOf course. Commerce is a field of knowledge exclusive to humanity. Oh, and I got something about that. Forget about the rancorous criticisms of our top economists and financial experts. I don't care if we're living on a sphere, on top of a pyramid, or a pillar. Makes no difference to us as long as the people living here are human. We never left ourselves. What I meant was that living at a new place didn't suddenly give us a new mind. \n\nThose who wanted to keep moving describe this place as untamed and filled with dangers. But I see a land untouched and filled with potential! I can't emphasize enough the immensity of the profits we can reap by investing in this project. The Virtues-series equipment is but the smallest step in our great strategy... And I am not the only one who recognizes this opportunity. You'd be wise to keep that in mind. \n\nMr. Derriam, before they fill the entire place up with people and start putting price tags on all sorts of \"virtues\" ... I promise, every cent you invest via this contract will grant you incalculable wealth in the future. \n\nOh, that's right! Just sign right there... I knew I saw a keen-eyed investor who saw exactly where the killing can be made—Hold on. Got to take this call. Yes? Good. Have him wait in the VIP lounge. \n\n——And that should wrap things up.

It never changed. \n\"They're just like what you told me...\" \nThe girl felt a little sad as her enthusiasm faded away to nothing.

It was her private corner, a tree hole to tuck herself into. \nIt was the place where the girl talked about things that frustrated her or made her happy. The room allowed her to divulge grave injustices she saw as well as incidents that made her upset. \nOne might ask if the person beyond the door actually listened, but the girl knew the answer better than anyone. \nPerhaps this was the reason why the place made her feel safe. Safe enough for her to share every fragment of her emotions. \nThe girl slowly got back to her feet. She looked down, but it was hard to tell if she was lonely or sad. \nThe girl made fewer and fewer visits to the cabin as the years passed. \nBut she never forgot about this private corner of hers.</>",

Your Nanna could never stop talking about her glorious achievement of being the first Cautus agent of the legendary security firm. Despite the innumerable martial feats achieved by our people, most Talosians still think that we Cautuses should be paper pushers seated behind office desks tall enough to keep our funny ears out of sight. \n\nWhile Mummy penned this letter at my desk, you were lying on the kitchen counter sticking your hands in a bowl of vege-mash. It was pouring throughout the night as the kettle bubbled on the stove. I know how much you loved the sound of boiling water. You'll be 6 on Wednesday and soon enough you'll be 16. That was Nanna's age when she first held this weapon. \n\nAt first, Mummy never wanted to inherit Nanna's lance. Eventually, however, I realized that it wasn't the weapon that turned Nanna into a loony bin. The lance used to be shorter as well. I asked Miss Bloch to personally fashion the extended shaft—and it's exactly as you heard it from your favorite bedtime story. Mummy thrashed a band of thugs in a penthouse ballroom at the tallest tower of the Band and saved Miss Bloch's life. I still remember how I leaped upon a vehicle hovering just beyond the roof with Miss Bloch in tow. Naturally, Miss Bloch was very thankful and we became very good friends. \n\nNow Mummy's gotta dash and escort some very important supplies to a faraway place. I'm afraid I won't be at home on Wednesday for your birthday, but I hope you'll like the lance. \n\nFor my favorite baby doll. Love you. Always.\n\nPS: It's best to leave the black D64 steel turbine on the thing. It's far more than just a piece of decorative accessory. If only you were there to hear Nanna ramble on about all those demonic blokes and stonespankers she faced in that nightmare of hers... if only Nanna were still with us. ",

Her eyes saw illusions and indescribable colors while her skin felt unreal sensations brushing against it. There were flashes of dizziness, bursts of murmurings, and fragments from the past. These were quickly followed by a bitter cold of winter trailing into something even more frigid. Everything felt so real to her. \n\nShe immediately asked everyone around and they gave her different answers. Some said it was over in a blink of an eye. Others panted with exhaustion and claimed that they were trapped in a stasis for days. \n\nShe was curious about the things she saw, for curiosity was part of her nature. She spent hours memorizing the patches, lines, and irregular hues of color that covered them. Yet all of them remained ephemeral and meaningless like the whimsical daydreams of spring. \n\nThen she saw a gossamer-like beam and a clear glimpse of the starry skies unhindered by the Barrier. \n\nShe witnessed Talos.\n\nTime did not bring sunrise to the polar regions of Talos-II. The huge, new world dominated everyone's view and it gripped her soul with a power that far exceeded the Arts of the Witch King himself. She could not avert her gaze. She could not have imagined how this natural-occurring astronomical entity enraptured her just as knowledge and wealth had seized her every attention. In fact, she was not sure if this view of the Universe could be classified as a natural phenomenon. \n\nShe took her time to inspect Talos. It was a massive yet almost motionless orb veiled in pale blue and decorated with ribbon-like rings. The blue might not be a native color, but a product of the atmosphere of Talos-II. She only saw such hues in the gardens of the old lady next door. As she looked on, she realized that the \"motionlessness\" of Talos was a visual trick it played on her. It moved at the smallest of places and shimmered ever so gently. She could hear the wind. \n\nHowever, the motions stopped quickly and Talos became an unmoving giant once more. Her heart raced as irregular explosions of thoughts, memories, and ideas surged through her mind. She remembered handing in her first Arts exam when she was still a girl and the moment when she completed her advanced studies at the Spire. She saw her parents, her mentor, the hand that reached out from the devastated ruins, and the flowing sands in the far distance. The last things she saw as she steadied her gait by the dark coastline were her own face, the skies of Leithanien, and childhood friends who counted the stars with her. All of them wore her own face. \n\nFor the first time in her life, she felt the powerful impulse of passionate love. Her heart yearned for Talos and she would do anything to touch the giant. \n\nIt was her belief that the giant celestial body was the knot that tied everything together. \n\nAnd these ties made the Originium flowing within her whisper into a chorus. \n\nThat was the day when she stopped changing. She must become a long-lived one, like the world she had hopelessly fallen in love with. ",

According to her words, the ring was more than just a symbol of her power. In fact, it served as Laevatain's demon-tracking tool as it would emit a unique hum that warned her of demonic presence as well as the locations of these entities. All she had to do after hearing the hums would be to purge the demons from existence. \nUnfortunately, the ring was severely damaged due to certain unknown reasons. Rhodes Island thus recommended Laevatain to approach Endfield Industries and asked if the Endfield Engineering Division (EF-ED) could help repair the artifact. Although EF-ED thoroughly inspected the ring, our engineers failed to identify the material used in its construction. \nLaevatain had mentioned \"demons\" in multiple occasions though no one was clear what she meant by these entities. A few postulated that these \"demons\" referred to a rare Aggeloid class. Some even treated Laevatain's metal ring as a special signal emitter. \nIt was Mr. Krad who finally ended this confusion. According to the veteran Endfielder, \"demons\" was an archaic term for describing Æthermorphs (Ætherside organisms or entities). Nevertheless, demons and Æthermorphs differed in many ways. Many organizations had still been trying to figure out the reasons behind the said differences. \nThis revelation made our EF-ED experts realize the possibility of a connection between the metal ring and the mysterious Ætherside. Following this logic, the Techno-Protocol may be key for repairing the ring. The final solution proposed by the EF-ED would be to install a suite of micro-scale Protocol Generators upon the ring. These generators would let Laevatain manifest the entire ring during battle. \nAlthough formal scheduling of the repairs proved difficult due to various reasons, Laevatain was pleased to know that a working solution was available. \nNOTE: Laevatain still had not explained how the ring was damaged in the first place. </>",

His long list of employment history includes stall vendor, electrician, carpenter, and chauffeur, but the Operator treated chef work as the crowning achievement of his professional career. Da Pan is extremely passionate about cooking and readily engages himself in the creation of new recipes, inventing fusion dishes, and identifying novel ingredients. His favorite pastime is to prepare palatable cuisine that diners might enjoy. \n\"Operator Da Pan's friendly enthusiasm and humorous personality during our conversation left a strong impression on me. However, when I verified his work experiences as an engineer with the Hongshan Academy of Sciences (HSA), Da Pan's expressions became visibly downcast and displeased. However, he quickly reverted to his hearty smile and changed the topic with a casual joke. \n\"I do not believe his personal disagreements with several Hongshan Tianshis would detract the value of his partnership with Endfield. Conversely, it proves that the self-professed chef also has the professional discipline and principles necessary of a true engineer.\" \n——Martin Marvin Malen, Assistant, HR Division, Endfield Industries</>",

  "4D50FBC6B49B1CED": "<@profile.key>Da Pan was assigned his private storage cabin that he stuffed with jars, casks, flasks, and bottles of culinary condiments and seasoning. Anyone fortunate enough to pass by while Da Pan cooked something at the cabin would be invited to have a bite of special side dishes or pickles he made. The panda might even decide to introduce personal mementos secreted away somewhere deep in the room: an empty jar and a yellowed newspaper from Hammerfell. \nThose lucky few reported that Da Pan spent years traveling across Talos-II and completely ran out of money in a southern city of the Civilization Band. The panda then opened up a street-side eatery. Business was bad at the beginning as many Banders were averse to Hongshan cuisine. A number of passers-by even complained about Da Pan's unclean wok, the excessive use of oil in his cooking, and his preference for cheap ingredients. \nBut true delicacies would not be hidden for long. Da Pan's insane wok tossing skills, the blasts of flames that gave Hongshan dishes the perfect heat and searing, and the irresistible aromas of legendary Wok Hey (the chi of the stir-frying pan) began to attract a growing number of patrons. Office workers tired of factory-made ready-to-eat meals heard of the panda chef and searched for his establishment. Business boomed and people had to queue long and hard for a seat. \nAn urban legend began spreading at that city. Diners were advised to ask Da Pan to add a spoonful of a <i>Mofa-Jiang</i> (magic sauce) to spice up whatever they ordered. Any dish with a dash of that <i>Mofa</i> sorcery would acquire a tasteful aroma of fermented beans, a rich multi-layered complex of flavors, and a perfectly balanced heat that tingles the palate. The combination left many diners hungering for more. That yellowed newspaper in Da Pan's collection happened to bear headlines that read: <i>Mysterious Hongshan Cuisine in the City - Biting into a Serving of Mofa Magic!</i> \nSometimes, a curious operator would ask Da Pan about that <i>Mofa-Jiang</i> and whether it was something that once existed in that empty jar of his. Da Pan would squint his eyes and, with a wiry smile on his face, say: \"It was never <i>Mofa-Jiang</i>, but simply Mrs. Pepper, the most common bean paste and fried chili blend of Hongshan!\" \n\"So why did you tell your diners and news reporters that you have a magical sauce?\" \n\"What? I never did that! Mrs. Pepper is notorious for her leaky jars, so I had to wrap this one in several layers of calligraphy practice scraps.\"</>",

Blegh!\" \n\n\"You're talking about the Ætherside?\" \n\n\"What else would I be talking about? Bloody glop central is a million times more confounding than the Aggeloi. I analyzed all the data we've scrounged together and my conclusion is that all the unobservable blind spots in the Universe may very well be obfuscated by the Ætherside. The closest one is just ... a hair's length away from this planet.\" \n\n\"By Talos, does that mean we're...\" \n\n\"That's right. The cosmos is a dangerous place, my friend. I don't think anyone from our generation could escape the grips of Talos.\" \n\n\"Oh... I was actually afraid of the Ætherside swallowing us whole. I guess you're really looking on the bright side of life.\" \n\n\"Who knows? Anyway, I wanted to figure out how this Ætherside appeared and get an exact date for the oldest etch figure we could find. This is why I decided to do some digging with you.\" \n\n\"Hmm. Qadja, if you figured that out, you would become the greatest figure in the fields of geology, physics, and astronomy... Heck. Kids in school would be forced to write essays on how your story inspired them to become nerds.\" \n\n\"Thanks for the encouragement, Morris. I'll definitely acknowledge you in my title page. Wait.

Wow!\" \n\n——A very old audio recording\n\n\"Professor Yvonne, is this the story of your mentor's mentor's mentor?\" \n\n\"To be precise, this incident happened before their stories began to trend. This is the last audio recording they made.\" \n\n\"What happened after that?\" \n\n\"Neither of them returned. People went through their belongings and found a piece of tillite, the first mineral sample with observable etch figures. My mentor's mentor's mentor managed to get his hand on this sample and it started his scientist career. People now call him the Father of Ætherside Sciences.\" \n\n\"So why are you telling me this story...?\" \n\n\"I thought you were the one who asked how I got started on Ætherside sciences, so I told you about the giants whose shoulders I've been standing on.\" ",

Many messengers come from ancient families dedicated to the profession whose ancestors worked the very same jobs in the world named Terra. \n\"Messages carry power,\" her father once told her when she was a little girl. \n\"Does that give messengers who deliver messages power as well?\" she asked. \nAvywenna would often ponder about this, even after she grew up. \nAvy's first job was at the Talos-II General Chamber of Commerce (TGCC). It was a place of lights, conspicuous consumption, and affluence. The pursuit of profit was inscribed within the genes of every individual and there was a price tag on everything and everyone. Neon lights illuminated and obfuscated murders, racketeering, falsehoods, and all manners of crime, and messengers happened to be those who tied everything together. Avy delivered more than just envelopes and packages. She was a courier of elaborate jokes, silent curfews, lies of Bander officials, leases of the desperate, heads, fingers, and nightmares. Her work in the Band taught her to smile without moving a strand of muscle around her eyes. \nOf course, Band work pays. A lot. \nMessages carry power in the Band. Avy's deliveries could cause stock prices to plummet or fill an entire establishment with bodies and bullet casings. \nMessengers must serve as the barrier to the things they carry. They were the silent and solid walls that protected their packages. Once the secret was entrusted to the hands of the messenger, they would see it delivered at once. Every job was nothing more than the pick-up point, the sender, the destination, and the recipient. True messengers would never dwell on the preludes, the in-betweens, nor the outcomes of the job. </>",

I loved the sight of seeing a convoy of armor shimmering in the Talosian sun. \n\nIt had nothing to do with discipline and it served little tactical purposes. The traditional code of the campaign knights were long abandoned—and I was the very one who cast it aside. \n\nI just liked being at the end at the marching column. I loved seeing the trail of crushed snow left by our exhausted soldiers as they ponderously marched across the soft white blanket of snow. Muscles and sinew spasmed in a chorus of muted pain. I enjoyed the sight of struggling and trudging masses whose throats were commanded to silence yet somehow found the strength to keep moving. \n\nI made headcounts in the frigid cold. I would count from 1 to 45. Sometimes I counted from 37 to 1. There were occasions when I recited <i>chleb serowy</i> 20 times to myself just to stay awake. The sound of delicious cheese bread always works. \n\nThe fact that not everyone died was enough to keep us going. \n\nThe great white flats laid before us. It was a novel sight at first. We were like curious children when we saw the strange skies and the thick, immense glaciers. But our curiosities quickly wore off because we saw the same things everywhere. Boredom then turned to fear when we saw the corpses in the glaciers, and fear itself eventually gave way to numbness when we settled into our fate. \n\nTruth be told, I could not bring myself to curse that icefield. In fact, I felt that I was the one who disturbed the majestic serenity of the new world. I was the one who triggered her fury when I entered her domain with childish thoughts of wealth and prestige. \n\nOur order was to march north. We were tasked to enter the heart of the icefields, pave a road, and build a base. But there was no end to the great white nothing and none of the rearguard managed to reach our position. Our casters failed to detect signals from our allies. Everyone was furious and those who still had strength paid ample verbal respect to the relatives of our so-called friends. Strangely enough, when the situation got worse, the thoughts of sublime virtue appeared in my mind. I never had those ideas before—At that moment, I prayed for our allies to give up this northward trek and abandon us. There was enough suffering. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. \n\nThe cold became our only companion. The sweeping winds numbed my arms. We encountered multiple clutches of Aggeloi during the latter part of our march. They did not attack us for reasons that elude me. There were times when I doubted the very physical existence of myself. \n\n\"No help is coming,\" our communication caster said as she took out the last Originium battery from a stricken drone and stuffed our last source of power into my hands. \n\n\"Record as much as you can. A verbal will or something. Let them know what happened to us.\" Those were her final words. \n\nThe last survivors shambled aimlessly in all directions. Their gaze were probably taken over by the darkness and could no longer see this blasted white infernal. Unfortunately, my innate Originium Arts kept my mind intact till the very end. I pushed over the staggering half-corpses, comrades who once marched along my side. I stepped on these barely struggling bodies and ascended the final hilltop. A dark, abyssal rift greeted my eyes. Talos lay in the far distance as the morning sun glistened off the planet and turned the snow into twinkling stars. The ruins and the smashed Ankhors looked as though they were placed there on purpose. The wind was bleached. Death tasted as sweet as honey. \n\nMy blade I plunged into the earth. This was the end of our campaign. Then I heard shouting, screeching, and the roaring of engines behind me. \n\nPerhaps I was hallucinating because the sounds were always so far away. Perhaps it took them years to arrive. Perhaps it took them decades. \n\nI don't care how long it took them. Someone better make a proper headcount this time. ",

She gently lifted the man onto her back, stepped on her snowboard, and speedily evacuated the place by sliding down the hill. \nWhile Snowshine evacuated to safety, the astronomer finally saw the atmospheric phenomenon that his team had set out to find. Powerful winds tore the thick clouds apart and allowed several twisted beams of light through the gaps. The result was a massive spiral that flickered with mysterious brilliance. \nWitnessing such wondrous sights made the astronomer shout out in excitement: \"The spiral lights!

  "54D985B5421A6B92": "<@profile.key>Endfield separately leased a lab at a UWST research center for Yvonne's use. Given the distance between Yvonne's lab and the Hub Base, the scientist rarely communed with her colleagues in Endfield. Chen Qianyu would be an exception. \nThe sunny girl from Hongshan was curious about everything and never lacked the energy to explore and ask. Chen, easily bored and always looking for something new, often visited fellow Endfielders, including Yvonne. \nYvonne did not feel distracted by Chen's visit. The scientist would in fact remind her by saying: \"Do not touch the devices and instruments because they actually do explode.\" \nChen, on the other hand, was not intimidated by Yvonne's warnings. Conversely, she became a frequent visitor. She didn't even have to knock. After passing facial recognition, the lab door would automatically open and Yvonne's drones would lead Chen through the mess of cables that sprawled across the floor. A massive servo arm would even serve the visitor drinks. If Yvonne was busy with something, Chen would sit in the lounge and flip through Yvonne's fashion magazines. They were guaranteed to be the latest and most comprehensive collection in the entirety of Valley IV. \nOne day, Chen visited Yvonne's lab to help her clean the place. While sorting out things on a desk, an old photograph stood out from amongst the numerous memos and handwritten notes and caught Chen's attention. \nChen was more than familiar with the place in which the photograph was taken. It was a natural wonder from her homeland, Hongshan. The area was deemed unsuitable for development, and featured a mountain that floated in mid-air. \nThis unusual phenomenon was caused by an Æther rift buried within the mountain range. Æther energy that seeped out of the rift bent physical laws and dragged the tail of the range into the air. Parts of the floating mountain remain attached to the land, creating a spectacle that resembled a legendary Feranmut of Yan raising its massive tail into the skies. \nMany Æther-caused wonders like this exist across Talos-II, with the Mountain Feranmut of Hongshan being the most famous. Since the site was close enough to various cities and settlements, it also attracted plenty of tourists. Most could only see the grand spectacle from afar, but this alone left a lasting impression on those who had witnessed it. \nUnable to suppress her curiosity, Chen asked Yvonne about the photograph and was surprised to get a childhood story from the scientist instead. \n\"I didn't get along with almost everyone when I was a kid. I thought people were dumb and slow and couldn't understand me. \n\"Naturally, dad and mom got worried I might end up becoming a weirdo. Haha... But they didn't give me lessons about the proper ways to behave. Instead, they took me to the mountains that reached for the skies. \n\"I was immediately drawn to the majestic sight. It was ... far beyond my understanding. My differences with other people felt insignificant compared to the great mysteries of this planet. \n\"That sparked my insatiable curiosity for this world. That visit made me aspire to unravel the secrets of the Ætherside. \n\"I no longer dwell on personal differences. And somehow that made dealing with other people a lot easier for me. \n\"And guess what,\" Yvonne smiled, \"I started making friends after that.\"</>",

She is currently an Endfield scientist and her areas of focus include the Ætherside and Ætherside-related technology and devices. Given her remarkable skills, Endfield offered her generous grants and resources to help her achieve scientific and research independence. \n\n\"Background investigation of Yvonne revealed an interesting finding. Her personal reviews on members of her team were very different from the reviews given by others. \n\"For example, a classmate regarded by the team as a skilled engineer was a determined and upright individual to Yvonne. Another classmate lauded as a prodigious mathematician was praised by Yvonne for her gentle nature. Years of experience working in the HR Division allowed me to notice Yvonne's unique skill of identifying personality strengths in other people. \n\"Yvonne's kindness and child-like naivety in the treatment of people around her might explain her ability to notice these facets of personality. However, I also believe Yvonne's unique skill may be a result of a second factor: the scientist was simply too skilled in her profession. Though this may sound cruel, Yvonne would barely notice the hard work nor skills demonstrated by her co-workers because she was just too good. All she noticed was their personal traits and perks. Both factors may be true as they are not mutually exclusive. \n\"One thing to note is that Yvonne must be given sufficient space and independence to conduct her work. I have no doubt that she would make an exceptional teammate, but her research projects tend to pose significant hazards.\" \n——Martin Marvin Malen, Assistant, HR Division, Endfield Industries</>",

The book received critical acclaim and Snowshine was even invited to an interview at the Civilization Band. When asked about her motivation for writing the book, the search and rescue (SAR) professional answered it was her desire to share her extensive experiences with everyone who needed them. Unbeknown to Snowshine, every commercial ad insert of the interview achieved success as well. High-altitude acclimatization medication and hiker rucksacks became the most widely sold products throughout the Band for that season. \nBlurb of Polar Survival Guide: \nIn the vast snowfields of Talos-II, survival is a challenge that everyone must face. Polar Survival Guide is a practical manual written by Endfield Operator Snowshine and is based on years of tried-and-tested experience of a true search and rescue professional. Any adventurer, pioneer, and caravan driver who wish to traverse the Talosian snowfields will benefit from the comprehensive and effective survival strategies contained within. \nContent summary: \nSURVIVAL TIPS: How to avoid snowfield hazards and disasters, tips on staying warm, and survival strategies in cold, resource-thin areas. \nADAPTING TO THE ENVIRONMENT: How to adapt to extreme climates as well as easy solutions to prevent and treat snow blindness, frostbites, and other common issues. \nMENTAL FORTITUDE: How to adjust yourself mentally for the wilderness, handling stress and staying calm in the wilderness, and ways to make the right decisions. \nGEARING UP: Essential gear and equipment for snowfield exploration as well as crafting of basic tools with resources and materials available in the wild. \nRESCUE ESSENTIALS: Series of SAR case studies based on the author's own experiences with added emphasis on teamwork and quick response. </>",

We have to deal with the Blight, the blasted Aggeloi, and an unforgiving and hostile world! This is why we need something indispensable to every community and civilization—WE NEED EXCITEMENT! \n\nAnd Little Jakub is right! We successfully preserved a few forms of entertainment from Old Terra. We got books, movies, cards, and video games. But why am I so passionate about this particular form of entertainment? Why do I keep harping all day about the Renaissance of the Majors? \n\nAlright! Settle down! SETTLE DOWN! And enough with the rumors! I'm no Terranist! I'm definitely NOT a Returnist! Talos is my sole focus! Do you think I'm doing all this because I miss Kazimierz? NIE! My old man didn't even leave me a photo of that distant place when I was born! \n\nNIE! My friends! I am a man of the moment! I care about the \"NOW\"! And this is why I spent my life's fortune to build this underground arena at my hometown! \n\nPeople! We're no longer on the spotless and elegant boulevards of Old Terra! We're on an alien world! A new land! A WILD LAND! Literature? PFFT. Movies?! BLEGH! These nonsense make our youths soft and shackle them to their cozy little bunks all day! Can you expect bookish nerds to haul carts of Originium Ore at a UWST factory? Will you feel safe if the Order of Steel Oath garrison their fortresses and fight the Aggeloi with skinny lads wearing thick spectacles? \n\nThink about the time when our youths fought in the Majors! Remember how they encouraged us to forge ever more powerful weapons and warriors! How it forced us to perfect our way of wielding the Arts! A sport that venerates our martial traditions is exactly what we need to fight and beat this unforgiving world to the ground! In other words—and this is for your ears alone—the TGCC and the military are definitely going to back us up for this great endeavor! \n\nNIE! NIE! We're not breeding barbarians or brainless muscleheads! The Major is indeed a martial sport, but its aim is to hone our physical and mental strengths! Isn't that the epitome of knightly virtues? \n\nEthics...? Yes, it might be ... necessary... But we also need to make money first. Rake in the creds and we'll talk about ethics later. \n\nEnough with your silly ideas, Redchin. I heard that your surgeon of a son was assigned to the North. You probably won't worry as much if the boy had more meat on him! \n\nOh! You're definitely right! In fact, I think the Order of Steel Oath will be interested in making an investment... Hmm. Think about this. If a few of our arena superstars get famous enough, we'll be attracting more than just one moneybag. That's what they told me about old Kazimierz! They created superstars out of their Knights! Super Knights! \n\nInvestment? Of course ... investments. Good people, I didn't call everyone here just to make you hear me waggle my tongue... Fine. I'll get straight to the point. I've already recruited the first batch of arena contenders. We got a few engineers, surgeons, and breakers... But these are just the appetizers. I found 2 actual veterans. They will give us the show we want! \n\nAh. You make a great point! That's the slow and steady way to go, but once I blanket every street and wall with posters of my exhilarating Major, the starting price would be way, way higher... Forget it. By the time the Oathkeepers approach me for an investment, I wouldn't need your money from your cereal trade no more, Wujek! \n\nAlright! Has anyone not signed? Good. \n\nNow since this pot of creds came from our family, it is only fitting that we name the arena after our family... IN FACT, when the Major becomes THE MOST IMPORTANT event in this world, the entire league will bear our name! \n\nThe Hannicke League! ",

However, my core philosophy has remained the same. We should not treat the Aggeloi purely as an enemy, and our studies on their other potential roles and/or uses should continue. \n\nFirstly, there is no evidence suggesting that all Aggeloi are under the control of Ankhors or the great nemesis in the north. A significant number of Aggeloi may have exhibited destructive behaviors, but their actions were not governed by any logic and we failed to discern any higher objectives thereof. Thus, the Aggeloid modus operandi can be safely considered as part of their natural instincts. And our own natural instinct is to take inspirations from various creatures and invent things that benefit human civilization. \n\nMuch has been achieved throughout the last century, the same century during which we strove to build a strong foundation upon Talos-II. However, we hardly made any progress in our understanding of the Aggeloi. The only thing we elicited was displeasure from the Sankta who felt extremely offended by how we decided to name these creatures. Our lack of knowledge about the Aggeloi is a travesty. I beg you to acknowledge the importance of my pursuit and offer a grant large enough to continue my research. \n\nThat being said, my team (which comprises my son) successfully captured a small Aggelos specimen in the wildlands. It was slightly smaller than an Originium Slug and resembled a clawbeast pup. Perhaps you think I would attempt to domesticate it, but that was not my intent. If that were possible, someone would have done it during the last 100 years. My objective was to identify parts of the creature that could be of use to us. \n\nInstead of physical or mechanical connections, the academic consensus believes that there exists some form of an energy or magnetic field between the Aggeloid tagmata and the \"joints\" of their 4 (and sometimes 8) segmented appendages. Field researchers had already provided witness reports of the Aggeloi \"activating\" these fields. \n\nPerhaps the working principles of this Aggeloid articular spatial field can be used in actual applications. Attaching Aggeloid components to 2 articulating parts of a robotic servo arm may provide the machinery with a ready and endless source of power. \n\nWith that in mind, I came up with an ingenious invention at my own residence—Aggeloid Auto-Nutcracker! I fashioned this particular device by attaching small, excised parts of an Aggelos onto a makeshift ram and base made from cast metal. Placing a walnut on the base and \"contracting\" the Aggeloid articular spatial field generated sufficient force to crush the walnut. \n\nI believe similar setups can be applied to other applications, so long as we find Aggeloid components of the right size and shape. \n\nAttached are detailed blueprints and instructions of the Aggeloid Auto-Nutcracker. I certainly hope to hear from you soon. ",

A decision had been made. \nEveryone was curious why their respected and steady-handed leader would appear so worried about this particular girl. All they knew was that the Endministrator left the operating theater completely exhausted and passed out on the spot. \nNobody knew what the Endministrator did, but the young girl miraculously survived and got back to her feet. She grew up while siphoning every form of knowledge as a flower would absorb nutrients from her surroundings. The girl exceeded every expectation and earned everyone's approval with her acumen and skills.

It gladdens me to know that our youths and children accepted their new home and were free of the nostalgia that never ceased to plague me. \n\nPeople still celebrated Mid-Autumn though the Twin Moons in full no longer graced our new skies. New Year remained a boisterous affair, but what was history to me became legends to our young Talosians. \n\nI treated my memories of Terra and Yan as my greatest treasure. I thought those memories would dim and fade with the years. However, as I got older, my childhood memories only became clearer—Countless times in my dreams I returned to the mountains of Shangshu, the deserts of Yumen, and the street markets of Lungmen. \n\nAnd it is with pleasure that I welcome my final days.

This situation could be easily excused by the novelty and fringe nature inherent to Ætherside research as the science placed unusually high demands on various tools, instruments, and facilities. Although we had secured various Civilization Band suppliers, most of them barely met Yvonne's precision and suitability requirements. \nOur auditors soon discovered that Yvonne had begun purchasing special sensors, electronic components, non-standard manufacturing modules, and an assembly deck furnished with a robotic servo arm. We asked Yvonne to clarify these purchases and we were not surprised by her answer: The scientist intended to modify and build her own scientific instruments. In fact, she had already taken the liberty of disassembling many earlier purchases for parts and components for modding purposes. After consulting Perlica, we changed the category of the disassembled tools to \"supplies\". \nMeanwhile, our Delta-system drone management team reflected that Yvonne had installed various modules on the units allocated to her. These modified drones would provide research assistance or serve as effective weapon platforms. Our staff also found that Yvonne had acquired admin-level authorization for these drones with her special programming skills. After extensive discussions, we would make relevant updates on our procurement records and no longer exert admin-level controls on these modified drones. \nCurrently, we have assigned a dedicated staff to liaise with Yvonne and monitor her latest lab activities. We have no intention to interfere with the scientist's work. The responsibilities of our dedicated liaison included: (i) recording the expenditures and products of Yvonne's lab and; (ii) providing constant updates to the Security Division. Both divisions had expressed grave concerns regarding the possibility of Yvonne making Æther explosives or other destructive weapons as well as the need to have a contingency plan in case that happens. \n—Internal memo, Procurement Division, Endfield Industries Company</>",

Astarron featured several hundred \"spokes\" that twist and rotate like a great circular vortex. When Astarron advances, it covers the land with an ominous shade of dark red generated by the Æther flowing in its immense form, a deathly zone for all living beings within.

The light finally revealed the images on the corridor walls. \n\n\"An invaluable trove,\" she said in hush tones, hardly able to contain her excitement, \"The gift of <i>Veritas</i>.\" \n\nLike a larva sensing the world with its feelers, she extended her pale, white fingers and felt the remains of ancient circuitries etched upon the walls. Those not chosen by Veritas would have treated these images as dirty and smudged scratchings from some forgotten time. \n\nThe Oathkeeper Knights kept interrupting Sister Jocelyn's adulation of these ancient works. Every time they rushed past her, she must stop what she was doing, bow her head, and curtsy accordingly. Some of the warriors ignored her. A few slowed their paces and nodded in acknowledgement. \n\nSetting aside the steel-like oaths and standard formalities that must be maintained, Sister Jocelyn knew that they regarded her as another \"eccentric from the tranquil place\". Only knights whose minds approached their breaking points would seek her for confessions of forgiveness. And those who do seek a Cabalist for aid would be considered odd. Abnormal, even.\n\nYet like migrating fowlbeasts, the Cabal of Tranquility always returned and gently roosted upon the shoulders of the great Order fortresses. The ancient scripts venerated by the Cabalists sat poorly with the curt and practical tongues spoken by the Oathkeepers of the Northern Desolation. \n\nBut none of this mattered. Everyone faced the same thing. Some fought, some prayed, some died, and some composed epics to sing of their glory. \n\n\"Hey, take this.\" \n\nSister Jocelyn's candlelight revealed a dreamy blue girl who gave her a metallic contraption. It was a blade, and a heavy one too. Jocelyn could hardly lift it with her hands. \n\nBeyond the window grille a thunderstorm broke loose. Lightning struck the blazing beacon on the fortress spire. The flash of light glinted off the heavy armor worn by the girl. \n\n\"Another host of the Aggeloi is assaulting our defenses,\" the girl panted, \"The place is safe, Mumu, but we don't know for how long. Go hide in the cellar. Use that to defend yourself.\" \n\nThe girl then dashed off to battle. Sister Jocelyn began to pray for her. \n\nAnd this was the blade from that tale.",

To quote a fellow operator who wished to remain anonymous: \"...She's like a dark box. You simply can't figure out how she managed to pull it off. And she did it all by herself.\" \nWe do not have much information on the Fiannæ Circuit. This nomadic organization was rather small. We deduced that the Circuit placed great emphasis on training extremely skilled warriors who can hold their own. \n\"I also find it hard to believe that Arclight is actually an instructor,\" the anonymous operator added. \nArclight would teach people knowledge of the Fiannæ Circuit at her outdoor classes (the locations of these classes were never the same). Sometimes, people who witnessed Arclight's lessons may change their views about her. The outdoor survival expert could easily detect the nearest source of water or mineral veins by tweaking her esoteric Fiannæ Circuit devices, or by sinking her fingers into the earth itself. \nWhenever Arclight tries to sense the environment, she would give off a strange aura that seems to harmoniously resonate with her surroundings. She would commune directly with every handful of dirt, piece of stone, growth rings of the trees, and drops of dew glistening on the petals. \nAnd when these ritual-like sessions ended, everyone would find themselves speechless. No words were needed to describe what they had seen. \nPerhaps moments like these would help you realize that Operator Arclight could be rather shy and easily embarrassed. </>",

  "7799665483F71FAB": "<@profile.key>A post from the Endfield Forum: \nOn the morning of September 26, the External-Communications Bus of the Cabal of Tranquility jointly partnered with Endfield Industries to organize the <i>1st Technological Mass and Seminary Discourse on the Pedagogy of Ancient Knowledge and Theories</i> with the aim of bolstering technological learning and information security training, consolidating faith in technology, and strengthening self-discipline and technological safety awareness amongst young members of the Cabal. \nFor the first stop of the joint program, Cabal members visited the Tranquil Congregation Hall. There, they performed their Morning Liturgies enlightened by the Supreme and Ancient Veritas itself. Thus guided by Veritas, the procession of Cabal members then made its way towards the Lithic Gate of the fort to search for the trails left by the pioneers who explored the lands of Talos-II 70 years ago. Observing the fine cracks and fissures upon the Lithic Gate and viewing of restored data allowed Cabal members to experience the First Sign of \"Resonance\" that was received at the very place. A group photograph was also taken with accompanying Endfielders. \nThe procession then quickly arrived at Dijiang and visited the Endfield Industries exhibit hall that showcased the organization's technological endeavors. Cabal members learned various concrete examples of Endfield Industries actively leveraging new technology to expand into the frontiers of Talos-II, as well as other innovative achievements in many scientific fields such as Originium electronics and Techno-Protocol mass transfer. While studying an actual working build of an Automated Industry Complex (AIC) production line, Cabal members acquired further insight on the synergistic combinations of ancient technology and emerging sciences. \nBefore the conclusion of the event, young Cabal representative Séraphine Xaihi exchanged her conclusions that summarized the sights she had witnessed today. Xaihi expressed that this pedagogical experience gave her fellow Cabal members a better understanding of the historical duty and future vision of the Cabal. She herself would participate in the first exchange program with Endfield Industries as an on-site liaison. The focus of Xaihi's mission would be to organically synergize the Cabal's mastery of ancient tech and the R&D capabilities of Endfield. Xaihi also emphasized that she would continue to revere knowledge, purge the aberrant, and pay homage to Veritas throughout her work. \nEvent attendants also included Dean Peter Alpha, Prioress General Lamire Alpha, and Vicar Juliette Delta of the Cabal of Tranquility as well as Supervisor Perlica of Endfield Industries. \n——Author: Avywenna, <i>Endfield Today</i>, Issue 193 \n\nANONYMOUS COMMENT A: Slogged here for years and never heard about Endfield Today. What happened to the other 192 issues? \nANONYMOUS COMMENT B: Looks like a joke article written for some funny news. \nANONYMOUS COMMENT C: Avywenna wrote this, so it looks pretty legit to me... \nANONYMOUS COMMENT D: What?!

Dijiang now has a crew of over a hundred Endfielders. And most of us aren't even from that special group of field operators. We're just common techies or ordinary mates of the ship. I remember a time when something broke down and fine-tuning the parameters took way longer than usual. Perlica recognized me during work. She came over, inspected my work, and then told me to get some rest and just get it done on the following day. Even reminded me to apply for OT. I was really touched. \n\"That's awesome.

She later visited the Civilization Band to answer the call of the <i>Ultimate Tribulation</i> before accepting an invitation to join Endfield Industries. However, her interviews with us revealed no further details about the said \"Tribulation\". \n\n\"Our first conversation with Ember revealed that she is a person with few words but often goes straight to the point. This is in line with other Oathkeepers we met. The military life of Oathkeepers instilled a powerful sense of duty within them. However, Ember has not divulged many of her secrets. An example would be what she described as the <i>Ultimate Tribulation</i>, something she mentioned often but never explained. \n\"During the interview with Ember, whenever our topic strayed to her personal objectives or future plans, she would appear momentarily confused. Her pragmatic personality would quickly take over as she steeled her looks and told us: 'We'll exterminate the Aggeloi and talk about that later.'—We believe that Ember has a need for an obvious enemy. Based on these observations, I am quite certain that Operator Ember will offer unreserved commitment to Endfield Industries. \n\"Though Operator Ember shared little about her past or her plans for the future, we should not doubt her willingness to support the Endfield vision. She told us that knights are oathbound to maintain the 'highest degree of loyalty' to their liege. I therefore strongly recommend establishing a long-term partnership with Operator Ember.\" \n——Martin Marvin Malen, Assistant, HR Division, Endfield Industries</>",

Puh-lease!\" \n\nAnd Miss Gilberta never refused them a tale. \n\nHowever, Miss Gilberta also couldn't bear to tell the same story twice. \n\nThus, Miss Gilberta arrived at bustling Aubornisk where trucks roared up and down the earthy roads. Giant wheels as tall as Miss Gilberta churned and created clouds of dust in the air. \n\nThey planted some Originium underground and it grew really well. Whenever they send off another truck-load of Originium, the crew's faces would light up, just like people who finally received a long-awaited delivery. \n\nThe city of Aubornisk was like hope itself. It grew bigger and stronger with every passing day. \n\nAnd that's what you should do as well, children! Grow big and grow strong! \n\nMiss Gilberta then arrived at the exotic coastal city of Lavandorma. As the sunset reflects off Talos around which Talos-II orbits, people pulled and sounded the steam whistles of their boats. Then they would sail into the sea and breath in huge mouthfuls of <i>Sal Viento</i> of <i>Nuevo Mundo</i>, the salty winds of the new world. \n\nLights from hundreds of boats illuminated the evening sea. In fact, there were so many boats that people \"walked\" upon the water by simply jumping from deck to deck. And yes! You can also dive into the sea and enjoy an evening swim. \"No celebration out there is better than ours!\" everyone in Lavandorma would say. \n\nBut nobody could remember why they celebrated that particular evening in the first place. But then again, you don't really need a reason to celebrate and be happy! \n\nAnd that's what you should be as well! Be happy! \n\nMiss Gilberta then arrived at majestic Wuling. It wasn't too long ago when the great city rose from the dense bamboo forests of Jinlong. \n\nWuling was a city of scientists who asked all sorts of strange questions and came up with all sorts of interesting answers. Of course, Wuling was also far more than that. \n\nSo, Miss Gilberta copied what everyone else did. She climbed and rubbed the Bastion with her hands. People say it always felt brand new to the touch! And then Miss Gilberta took part in a high jump competition with robots to the great amazement of the Tianshi masters who looked on with awe! She also rode a burdenbeast to see oceans of rice seedlings swaying in the breeze. \n\nLearning is important, but don't forget to have fun and exercise! \n\nOf course there's no way that Miss Gilberta will miss out on the spectacular Talos City! It is a grand metropolis that brought people close to the edges of the sky! A huge cosmopolis of silvery avenues, marble white arches, and skyscrapers of all sorts of blue and golden hues! \n\nTalos City is also where you could find the UWST Headquarters, the Corporate Capital of the TGCC, the Representative Central of Endfield Industries, and the Hall of the Office of Messengers ... Oh, Talos City is indeed the city of Talosian desire! \n\nDon't ever miss it! Visit the place when you grow up! \n\n\"Miss Gilberta! Please tell us more!\" \n\nMiss Gilberta was stuck. She tried to think of a new story. \n\nShe remembered what she felt when she held the Originium crystal...\n\nAnd what she felt when she laid on the sea...\n\nAnd what she felt when she looked at the scale model of that arch...\n\nAnd fuzzy memories of that special someone when the noonday sun poured through the gaps of the bamboo canopy.\n\n\"Hmm... It's a secret!\" \n\nMiss Gilberta was too embarrassed to tell them that story. \n\n\"Heehee. Sorry, kids. I'll definitely come up with another story next time.\" ",

  "8AE1541C5A849F59": "\"Our home, Terra, lies somewhere faraway in the vast voidness of the endless space.\" \n\nShayen did not feel sadness when he heard that the entirety of the Aerospace Research Center was to be disbanded. Trained as a scientist, Shayen successfully steered his rationality to govern his mind and actions for the past few months. He understood the challenges faced by humanity on Talos-II. Northmarch Support Hub had taken on an immense mission. Space exploration must make way for more pressing matters and important projects. \n\nBut as Shayen packed and moved his personal belongings from the lab he worked at, he could not help but look at the 2 volumes of <i>Ferdinandian Physics</i> on the bookshelf. An indescribable sense of emptiness and defeat washed over him. He reviewed his life. Everything he worked for and loved became mere exhibits covered by canvas. \n\nShayen remembered the childhood fairytale about the Dusk Beauty and how she flew to the moon, the teenage science fiction novels of high adventure in outer space he read as a school kid, and the empirical laws laid down by the legendary physicist Ferdinand Clooney. He had always felt that his soul was never trapped to a single world. \n\nFor the past 40 years, Shayen spent most of his time working on Originium propulsors, heat and Blight resistant materials, processed and compressed Originium fuel, and other technological instruments and products too esoteric for the laypeople. He worked with teams who shared his vision of reaching out into space itself. Though he never saw Terra, he had faith that she existed somewhere in the infinite cosmos. To reach out for the stars was to start a journey of endless questions, results, and answers. \n\nShayen made an important decision that night. He ignored the regulation that required him to archive years of his research notes and results. Instead, he secreted a copy into a data disk along with the blueprints. He then contacted the director of innovations and science at Northmarch Support Hub. Many of the world's brightest minds toiled for years on these next-gen technologies. Even if the descendants of Terra no longer yearned for the stars, these discoveries and knowledge will help them explore the new world of Talos-II. \n\nHe must give meaning to everything they had done.

He wiped the bloody bubbles of spit from his lips with a muddied sleeve and approached the huge figure. The shattered remains of dead Aggeloi surrounded him. Jerreth picked up the man's broken weapon and tossed it aside to make room for a seat. \n\n\"We were heading south. WE WERE HEADING TOWARDS THE BLASTED SOUTH! Nobody knew we were going south until we started down the road!\" \n\nJerreth toyed with the pen in his hand. Without ink, it was little more than an empty tube. \n\n\"I ... I don't know what to write... How should I report this? Gah... I should get the hell out of this place.\" \n\nThe supplies on the trailer truck were completely destroyed.

You were the only one who could see this through... the only one...\" \n\n\"I'm just a journalist! How would I write about this crushing defeat?

He did not stop shaking since the fight began. \n\nAfter quite a while, he finally stood up and felt the northern breeze brushing against him. \n\n\"There was this story. The hero's name was finally recited in an epic paean, his deeds glorified and enshrined by the lines. There is no such thing as a silent and ignominious death.\" \n\n\"I'm going home,\" he murmured as he cast everything aside. He threw away his memories, career, and responsibilities at this very site right next to the suit of heavy armor. \n\n\"I'm going home...\" \n\nAnd thus he left a trail of footprints as he trudged towards a certain direction.

The frontside of the establishment was an eatery, and the repair mart was around the back and resembled more like a secret workshop. The only way in was the backdoor but the backyard gate was locked tight. It looked rather deserted when compared to the boisterous bustle of the eatery. \nBai Yong knew how to get in. A bunch of keys was hidden under the third flower pot along the window ledge. He took the keys and opened the mailbox by the door. Da Pan hid the door card there. \nAfter entering the work room, Bai Yong would usually find Uncle Da Pan crouched over the counter like a mountain of black and white. He was always tinkering with his gadgets or repairing his iron wok. And for this day, the eatery was closed. \n\"Patron... oh,\" Uncle Da Pan said as he nudged the shades to his forehead. \"Had lunch yet, boy? I got something simmering in the pot.\" \n\"Not hungry.\" \nBai Yong sat on the stool with his good hand on his waist as Uncle Da Pan applied lubricants on the actuators. The panda was a reputable expert on maintaining Xiranite prosthetics and quite a few city folk would seek his services. However, he refused to admit that he had worked on the material before. \nWhile working on the boy's arm, Da Pan would tell him stories, experiences, and sights he had seen while he worked as a nomadic trader. \n\"Those places sound really far away,\" Bai Yong said, \"I don't think I'll make it out there.\" \n\"You'll get used to it, boy. You just need to take the first step.\" \n\"I can't really leave this place. You know that. I gotta defend the Bastion for mom and dad.\" \n\"Visited them recently?\" \n\"Just last week. I had to go myself. I don't know where Yuan ran off to.\" \n\"Well, boy. You're really putting the chrome to use. The bearing balls are worn down. I'll replace the axle for you.\" \nThe tinkering took a while. \n\"Alright. Time for v&v. Show me what you got, boy!\" \nThe thick, bulging, and hairy panda arm was on the table. With a resounding \"SMACK\", Bai Yong grabbed the panda's hand with his right hand and the two arm-wrestled for a while. Uncle Da Pan looked satisfied. \nAfter validating the repair job, Bai Yong told Uncle Da Pan about his intern work last month and the people he helped. The youth mentioned how he managed to see Tianshi Zhuang while maintaining order at the ceremonial grounds, and how she... \n\"Enough. Don't like listening about this one.\" Da Pan almost growled. \n\"Wha?\" \nDa Pan quickly put aside his toolbox and gave Bai Yong a hefty slap on his organic left arm. \"Alright. I will see you. LATER!\" \nThe panda picked him up like a toy and tossed him out of his establishment. Bai Yong remained confused as the door slammed shut right before him. Uncle Da Pan's temperament was always weird. \nBai Yong moved his chrome. The joints were as good as new. He felt great. </>",

He reminded me to keep to my objectives of investigating the region and avoid any confrontation. But my sage worried too much—I hardly met any breakers on my way to the Valley. However, I met an Ursus carrying a surprisingly large load of pots, pans, and other belongings. I offered him assistance as he seemed to be in a rush but he turned it down. What a strange individual. \n\n......\n\nThe Ursus seemed to be a chef and I must confess that he was the best I had ever met. But this was not entirely good news—the smell of his food attracted many breakers. The Ursus was oblivious to the approaching raiders as he was wholly focused on his makeshift stove and the food. It was a terrible battle and I was barely able to chase them away. Before I passed out, I heard the Ursus complain: \"Should've played nice, kid. Why fight when you could send them off happy and fed?\" \n\n......\n\nI continued to travel with the Ursus after I came around. We learned more about each other but he started asking me increasingly annoying questions. Right before I told him to muzzle himself at the peak of my rage, an Ankhor streaked across the sky. Something was indeed happening at Valley IV. \n\n......\n\nThe Ursus probably noticed my nervousness. It was indeed my first time seeing the Aggeloi. I told him to leave but failed to hide the trembling in my voice. \n\nIn response, the Ursus gave a booming laugh, tossed his wok aside, and charged straight at the Aggeloi. I could not believe how the mound of blobbing fat moved so fast and so flexibly. With a single hand, he slammed an Aggelos with a force so great it was pinned to the ground. His other hand held a cleaver that he swung like a skilled hunter deboning a cystybeast. It only took him a few simple strokes to turn the Aggelos into rubble. \n\nMy sword was shattered by the end of the battle but his cleaver remained as sharp as new. \n\n\"Here. You can borrow this for a while,\" the Ursus tossed me a bundle that was narrower and longer, \"Remember. You're just borrowing it. Return it to me when you visit Wuling City.\" ",

They brought many bags and suitcases and started living at several large hotels or rented houses near a number of major installations and facilities. These mysterious Banders did nothing else and would not leave their rooms or houses for days on end. No one knew what they were doing. \nBut people got suspicious as the rooms and houses these Banders stayed at exhibited hastily covered up damages to the walls, flooring, and waterproofing layers. They were no ordinary dealers, but a team of industrial spies who infiltrated Wuling to create illegal blueprints and steal secrets of Hongshan architecture, construction technologies, and even Xiranite itself. Having learned of this, the City Guards immediately deployed a task force to arrest the spies, but they already packed what they were looking for and were on their way out of the city. \nEveryone was surprised when the chef named Da Pan would show up at the Guards. The owner of an eatery at the city suburbs brought with him dozens of bags and suitcases of various sizes. The Guards searched them and found numerous custom-made surveillance instruments, construction tools, and a stack of hand-drawn engineering and architectural blueprints. Verification revealed these drawings perfectly matched the hotel rooms and houses that these so-called Bander \"merchants\" stayed at. \nThe Guards were extremely grateful to Da Pan for recovering intel on key Hongshan secrets. When questioned by the Guards Captain, Da Pan did not reveal much about the retrieval of the bags and suitcases involved in the crime. The panda only mentioned that he was in the construction sector before and currently worked as a consultant at a trading platform for construction supplies. Strange job postings appeared on the platform a while ago and Da Pan guessed that an organization was trying to steal some \"illegal rubbing\" and thus tracked their activities for days. \nBefore leaving, Da Pan also told the Guards Captain something rather cryptic: \"Heard about my establishment out in the suburbs? Heh. I took a really long while to pick that perfect spot.\" </>",

The old man's eyes were cloudy with cataract, but his judgment of character remained sharp. \n\"Am I getting laid off?\" Avy asked and tried to look as relaxed as she could. \n\"I don't know what's buggering your conscience, but it's blighted enough that you felt compelled to do charity work in this dust-ridden armpit of Talos-II,\" Laine grumbled, \"But I rather drink burdenbeast piss than see you waste your remarkable talents here, Miss Avy.\" \n\"Burdenbeast piss? Hmm. How does it taste like?\" Avy quipped. \nThe postmaster gave her a cold hard look before opening the old terminal that he had used for decades. He hammered away at the keys and quickly produced a letter of recommendation. \nShe took the letter and warily looked at the new place she was being recommended to. Endfield Industries. Laine told her that Endfield was built by a band of idealists. Avy snickered with disdain. \n\"Idealists? Thought this species went extinct years ago.\" \n\"No, but I think you can help,\" Laine replied. \n\"Make them better idealists, you mean?\" \n\"No. You can help with their extinction.\" \nAvy laughed. She then packed her things and left. \nShe only learned about the old postmaster's past after arriving at Endfield. The disinterested robot that served as the Endfield Industries HR assistant suddenly livened up when it heard the name Howard Laine. It immediately inquired Avy about Howard's current status. The messenger replied that the old man was running a rundown mail depot that serviced no more than 20 households across an area of around a dozen square klicks. The HR assistant nodded and immediately arranged for her onboarding. \n\"Is that all the information you need?' Avy was quite surprised. \"Please don't tell me that you Endfielders like hiring the weird and freaky.\" \n\"Howard Laine is an Endfielder who honorably retired from his position at the Special Logistics Module,\" the robot replied, \"We have faith in his judgment of character.\" \nAfter a brief pause, the robot added: \"The Endministrator made this rule.\" \n\"What rule?\" \n\"That we Endfielders must be united by our faith and confidence in one another.\" \n\"Hurrrr, interesting,\" Avy replied, \"So, do I get a chance to meet this legendary Endministrator?\" </>",

Most Landbreakers of obviously malicious clanns are incapable of infiltrating Valley IV as they grew up in extremely hostile environments. The LB manner of speech and behavior would quickly expose any LB agent, no matter how good they were disguised. Hence, the LBs would hire ordinary-looking nomads or disaster victims with bribes that \"look like a great deal\" and have them infiltrate various outposts, towns, and villages to steal tech documents or products of the latest technology. This naturally gave rise to a special group of spies hiding within frontiersfolk and nomad populations. These frontier agents are professionally committed to the criminal activities I described.",

There are tales of her defeating over a thousand enemy soldiers with her dual swordbreakers at Kjerag. Those tales would prove my hypothesis.</i> \n\n<i>The Blood Knight was even stronger and his tactics were widely studied.

He was literally a one-man army who dominated the field.</i> \n\n<i>As for the battle records of the Radiant Knight ... words alone won't suffice. There was no question about her impeccable technique but everyone knew she owed her success not to the battle itself. Anyone armed with such levels of conviction could step onto the field with different weapons and tactics and become like the Radiant Knight herself. Of course, such levels of faith and belief would be impossible to learn.</i> \n\n......\n\n<i>This Knight... wait. He's a knight, right? When and where did they make this recording? No ...

Teammates gained better physique and mastery of SAR techniques as team cohesion and responsiveness grew by leaps and bounds. \nDuring an internal battle simulation tourney, Snowshine's SAR Team defeated a string of other contenders with their incredible teamwork and morale. The final match saw Snowshine's SAR Team battling Chen's elites. Snowshine demonstrated incredible tactical acumen as she directed her teammates to cover each other against Chen's relentless assaults. Though many of her attacks were blunted by Snowshine's stalwart defenses, Chen's onslaught gradually took out the SAR team members one by one. Snowshine bravely weathered Chen's unending storm of blades with her shield, but her endurance and strength finally reached the breaking point and she finally collapsed with exhaustion. \nIn the following morning, Snowshine was greeted by many new faces at the gym. Many Endfielders were inspired by Snowshine's indomitable will during that famous battle and applied to join her SAR Team. </>",

The fall of any Oathkeeper, no matter their skill in arms, is a grievous loss for the defense of this civilization.\n\n......\n\nThe host of Aggeloi is a unique form of life. Though the host has no combat techniques or strategies to speak of, it also feels no pain or fear. The host never retreats and simply keeps fighting until the last Aggelos is slain. Extended Aggeloid crusades often dull the minds and senses of Order soldiers. The Oathkeepers do not detest the killing. No. They simply realized that the host of Aggeloi could crush entire mountains with their weight of numbers alone. \n\n......\n\nI humbly propose to arm our common soldiery with lances and spears. These ancient weapons will find new purpose in the Aggeloid crusades. The length of the weapons will let our soldiers attack these abominations from safer distances and the sharp, tapered tips should be sufficient to puncture their defensive shells. We must also design new arms strong enough to withstand the weight of these inorganic creatures. And the tips require sharper tips. The sharper, the better. \n\n......\n\nI've sent my blueprints to our headquarters. The lance and spear have always been the mainstay of every army in history ranging from Kazimierzian Knights to Sarkaz mercenary bands. They shall serve once more in our crusades. ",

Band cities and neighborhoods must work closely together to survive, yet many Banders chose to leave the city behind to live as a nomad or prospector in the frontiers. \n\nI myself wasn't too surprised by this. These people had lost too much. I interviewed around a dozen refugees last week from a disaster-stricken neighborhood that ran out of food. They had no other choice. \n\nHowever, there were also some who refused to live in a world of law or were simply sociopaths. These individuals preferred a life filled with constant violence and danger. \n\nRegardless of their intents, no Bander nomads could truly give up the touch of civilization. Also last week, I saw them craft weapons with a scavenged machine tool. I was extremely curious how they managed to get their hands on a working lathe. The answer was simple. They got lucky with a scavenging run through a Bander city dumpsite. These landfills provided for their every need. \n\nTurned out that <i>Bander Scav</i> was a pretty accurate name for these people. \n\nIf you're reading this, tell that little Bander journalist to stop stalking me. People who complain about sleeping bags do not belong in the wildlands. She should get back to her cushy Bander place and stick to being a celebrity tabloid writer. ",

I kept telling her to change out of her crew outfit first. I felt I wasn't getting hugged by mom. I was getting crushed by a hardware store and always ended up with a mess of sore, reddish imprints of hammers, pliers, wrenches, and even a big blasted handcannon on me. \n\nAnd then she bought me those friggin' buggly toys, you know. I've been seeing actual cranes, drill crawlers, dumpster trucks, crushers, and pile drivers in real life. I saw entire fleets of steel giants heading north every friggin' day and every friggin' year of my childhood. I did not want mini and fake versions of them in my toybox. \n\nAnd mama never treated this world as \"home\". She never stopped saying: \"Talos-II is just too dangerous. We'll never make this our place.\" \n\nI'm a Talosian, born and raised, and could never really understand why she never stopped complaining. Yet those words left an imprint on me, like those hardware tools she carried when she gave me those powerful, crushing hugs. I never knew what \"imprints\" meant back then. \n\nThen came a day when mama failed to come back from the north. Uncle Walther gave me her outfit. Them laundry crew didn't wash it right and it still had this dark bloodstain on the collar. I held it tight to feel the familiar coarseness of the fabrics and the cold, hardness of her tools. And then I found that blasted handcannon—the big iron responsible for all those painful imprints I suffered. The thing sported a new dent beneath the barrel. \n\nShe emptied the magazine and then slapped an Aggelos real good with that big slab of iron. \n\nI asked Uncle Walther to cast me a new barrel and furnish it with a chain cutter. I also got mama's position when another convoy roared for the north. \n\n'Cause I'm the hardest wedge to be hammered into Talos-II. ",

These people developed a unique culture centered around the idea of \"simplicity\". No. \"Restraint\" would be a better word. They might not have the best technology, but they made the most out of every material. These people crafted tools with a unique minimalist aesthetic—a style of beauty molded by the harsh and unforgiving wildlands of this untamed world. \n\nI told them I was a crafter and it gave me a chance to take part in their work. Observing their craftsmanship up close gave me a rather shocking revelation—their weapons were fashioned using far less materials and simpler processes, but overall performance was only marginally less than our TGCC counterparts. This discovery made me realize that our designs actually have plenty of room for improvement. \n\nI left the Circuit after spending 3 whole years with them, and they gave me honors befitting their own sages. Deep down, I learned far more from the people of the Circuit than what I taught them in return. ",

During cylinder casting, make sure you use precision casting techniques to eliminate all bubbles and cracks. The cast cylinder must undergo heat treatment to improve its hardness and wear resistance. The Originium core is the heart of any engine. This must be handled properly to ensure stable engine output and eliminate the risk of accidents. Assembly is your next step. The cylinder must be perfectly fitted with all mechanical components. Position the Originium core in the center of the cylinder to ensure smooth energy transfers. Use only precision assembly for transmission components like the crankshaft or gears. This will eliminate friction or noise when running the engine. Once assembly is complete, run a preliminary test without load to see how the engine performs. Repeat the test while increasing the load to assess power output and stability. If the cylinder overheats or if noise is getting excessively loud, you might have a problem with the cooling system or a worn transmission component. Stop the test and check your engine immediately. Finally, check if your engine can run smoothly and safely under high temperature and pressure. If you pass this test, your Originium engine is finally complete. Simple, right? Anyone who can't do this from scratch must have a skill issue.",

  "B4001D078067E41A": "I lived at a small village before I became an Endfielder. It was more like a makeshift camp. Both the UWST and TGCC had plans to develop the surrounding region. The area was jointly managed by the 2 organizations and we had all sorts of people. Despite the shoddiness of the place, it was lively and boisterous. \n\nI remember a particular evening when I saw a few Sarkaz squatting in front of the door of my cabin and munching on their rations. They were members of the UWST crew, but none of them had their shirts on and bared their stocky bodies to the wind. All of them were typical Sarkaz, Oripathy-positive and capable of wielding the Arts. They were my people. When they saw me, they gave a rather embarrassed smile and moved a bit so I could leave my cabin. \n\nAnother UWST crew with the same outfits partied around a bonfire not too far away from them. They laughed, cheered, and munched on the same rations. They danced around the fire and sang songs from their homes. \n\n    \"Munched on the same rations...\" \n\nI hope you understand what that meant, Supervisor Perlica. \n\nLife for my people had changed a lot. My Grandpapa had lived for over 200 years and he would tell me stories about Kazdel. The other Talosians might tolerate us more than their ancestors did back in the days when Grandpapa lived on Terra. People no longer feared our Arts and Oripathy was no longer the killer it once was thanks to the efforts of numerous scientists and surgeons. I have many friends of other races and we all received the same education. However, thanks to our innate skills in the Arts and our powerful build, my people and I either became indispensable forces of labor or soldiers fighting against the Aggeloi and the Blight. \n\nThings might look fair. Every crew mate and worker munched on the same rations. \n\nBut my people were left alone to themselves. Every race had fun at that bonfire party. Every race except for us. \n\nSometimes I'd think that the way people tolerated the Sarkaz was by forgetting that we *are* the Sarkaz. Is this a forced construct of \"equality\" built upon a deliberate exclusion and neglect of the differences that separate our histories, cultures, and languages? \n\nThe Talosian condition was a vast improvement over the Terran injustice we endured. During Grandpapa's times, my people would treat my words as paranoid ramblings and unrealistic demands of a pampered and insatiable child. \n\nBut I must ask this question. Who can protect the integrity and values of being a Sarkaz? My people would not earn respect if things go on like this. Instead, we could become a domesticated species serving the interests of others. \n\nI chose to become an Endfielder because I believe that Endfield was not such a place. I was overjoyed to win the approval of my fellow Endfielders. I will also remember the time I spent with the scabhta of the Circuit as well as the kind words that Martin Marvin Malen lavished me with. But I have my dreams, Endministrator and Supervisor Perlica. I have my own vision for the Sarkaz. \n\nAnd so I must decline this offer of becoming an elite operator of Endfield Industries. \n\nPerhaps I will reconsider, but this is not yet the time. ",

A decision had been made. \nEveryone was curious why their respected and steady-handed leader would appear so worried about this particular girl. All they knew was that the Endministrator left the operating theater completely exhausted and passed out on the spot. \nNobody knew what the Endministrator did, but the young girl miraculously survived and got back to her feet. She grew up while siphoning every form of knowledge as a flower would absorb nutrients from her surroundings. The girl exceeded every expectation and earned everyone's approval with her acumen and skills.

No. We found only engines of war that the Ursine were forced to abandon in the Great Rift Valley and the ruins of automated pastures given up to the hosts of Aggeloi and the never-ending Blight. \n\nThese discoveries were little more than rotting crates of our mundane past. \n\nThe true history of Talos-II would be the ruins left behind by our ancestors—And I unearthed 3 of these sites. All were empty. We found no bodies, no sources of power, and no machineries. There was nothing. Nothing but shards of metal. They did give off a light that I could peer into. I saw fuzzy images of our ancestors who lived eons ago. I saw them smile. The smiles looked genuine. Our ancestors looked happy. \n\nNone of our discoveries revealed what happened before us. In fact, our very own past remains shrouded. Talos-II continues to hide behind the obscuring veil. A scabhta of the Fiannæ Circuit told me their very first sage caught a glimpse of the world's shadowy past in the frozen icefields. This tiny glimpse scarred her with a monumental terror greater than Talos itself. \n\nI told this to an Oathkeeper friend of mine. She replied with her own tale. Whenever she stood atop the Order fortress walls and gazed into the thick dark clouds that smothered the northern skies, she could feel the planet's shadow lurking behind it. This shadow would briefly retreat whenever she stepped onto the battlefield. \n\n\"Be strong, and do not think too much about it.\" \n\nThose were her words when she gave me her handcannons. \n\nFine. I'm putting off the retirement. I'm heading out there again. ",

As far as I know, he had survived solo operations in almost every hazardous/dangerous environment we have on the record. \n\"Wulfgard is extremely skilled in solo operations and covert missions. However, the Operator seems unmotivated in any form of socialization nor has he made any attempt to handle any social issues he might have with others. We recommend giving Wulfgard solo assignments if team operations are required. \n\"It is important to note that Wulfgard gave exceptional performance in physical strength and reflexes based on existing test records. The Operator is also highly proficient in all manners of close-quarters battle. If pressed by the situation, Wulfgard could quickly weaponize anything within reach—even a fountain pen.\n\"Thanks to his extensive experiences living in the wilderness, Wulfgard knows exactly how to handle all sorts of environmental hazards and dangers. He is also a skilled negotiator with frontier settlers, especially when it comes to matters regarding the Landbreakers... We believe every operator who worked with Wulfgard has been impressed by this unique skill of his.\" \n——Martin Marvin Malen, Assistant, HR Division, Endfield Industries</>",

Unfortunately, the file contained very little information and the Rhodes Island management gave only ambiguous answers to my inquiries on this matter. \n\"I noticed a barely detectable hint of curiosity in Laevatain's gaze when she entered the meeting room.

Laevatain demonstrated a willingness to listen and articulated herself clearly. She even described her motives for contacting Endfield and the aims she hoped to achieve. I did not even have to ask. \n\"Although Laevatain professed to be a solo combatant, she performed remarkably well in a simulated team battle. She quickly identified the strengths of her team members, used them to come up with an effective team strategy, and successfully achieved the objectives.

  "C93F10CF99284555": "<@profile.key>Before the Bastion Incident, Bai Yong was always the first to raise his hand. On his first day of school, the boy eagerly introduced himself before the entire class. \n\"Greetings, ma'am. Greetings, my fellow classmates. My name is Bai Yong. 'Bai' meaning white, and 'Yong' meaning the bastion that protects the city. My parents gave me this name because they're both Tianshi working on the Wuling Bastion!\" \nThe boy stood proudly before his class. \nAfter the Bastion Incident, Bai Yong became silent and he no longer smiled as he laid on a hospital bed marked with his name. Medical staff of Wuling 1st General Hospital described Bai Yong as a strong and determined child. Despite undergoing dozens of surgeries that failed to save his right arm, the boy did not shed a tear. \"The loss of his parents robbed him of his tears.\" \nBai Yong's younger sister Bai Yuan was the one who cried and laughed during this time. The girl remembered little of her brother's arm and her parents. Bai Yong hardly mentioned them when she was around. \nThe boy felt compelled to grow up, and quickly. \nThe damaged Bastion was slowly being rebuilt as Bai Yong recovered and grew up in the hospital. The medical staff moved him to a bed with a window view so he could take a closer look. \n\"It hurts, doesn't it?\" someone asked. \nBai Yong turned around. A long-haired woman with a bandaged arm stood by the door. \n\"I was talking about your arm.\" \nThe boy shook his head. \"It hurts when I feel its absence.\" \nShe came over and sat by the side of his bed as she gazed at the Bastion outside the window. \"It'll grow back.\" \n\"Can you grow the Bastion?\" \n\"We used something called Xiranite to build the Bastion. Your parents were masters of that material,\" the woman continued, \"They wielded it as though it was an extension of their own bodies.\" \n\"You knew mom and dad?\" \nShe shook her head. \"I heard they were very brave.\" \nThe woman left. Bai Yong felt she acted very weird as a stranger whom he never met before. \nSeveral days later, an entire medical crew entered the boy's ward. They took blood samples and ran some tests. He was put through various diagnostic machines and analyzed repeatedly. The crew finally ended the day with a joyous announcement. Bai Yong became the first beneficiary qualifying for the Xiranite Prosthetic Charity Program of Wuling. \"You'll be growing a new arm!\" \nWhenever Bai Yong remembered this, his palm would heat up. </>",

Whenever the wind kicked up the sand, she would raise her head to look for the hazy beacon of light. It was the destination of every fully laden truck convoy. \n\nThose who live in the frontiers felt ambivalent about the city. But Arclight noticed that frontiersfolks who once benefited from the Circuit's teachings would disappear whenever the city added a new district and expanded its borders. Everyone wanted to be in the concrete jungle. The city swelled and the lights grew ever more resplendent. \n\nSome claimed that they could see the city lights from the uninhabited zones in the extreme north. Arclight was not one of them. The city had set its roots at a place and that would be where it would grow. Growth has its limits, and the reach of the lights is not infinite. If the polar north had lights, they would not be lights of its own, but the fluorescent neons of a brand new city. \n\nArclight never detested the place. It was just another piece of wildland that happened to be called a \"city\", just another place where people gathered to face the crisis. The city devoured people rejected by the wildlands while truck convoys served as the blood circulating throughout the corpus of civilization. \n\nThough Arclight did not hate the place, she could not tolerate the deafening din that shook people's souls and muted the engine roar of her metal steed. \n\nShe swerved around and left. Talos City would continue its unchecked growth across the sand swept wildlands. The great city continued to stand, and its lights continued to blaze.",

During this period, HR Division once again received reminders about Yvonne as well as \"strange explosion-like noises\" and \"unusual energy readings\" emanating from her lab. During the extensive discussions that followed, Yvonne skillfully lowered the effects of her work to a level that most of her neighbors found tolerable. \nHence, the HR Division simply passed over earlier concerns regarding Yvonne's \"mental well-being\". \nThings continued until Andre paid Yvonne a visit for their work. The engineer reported seeing Yvonne mumbling to herself as she installed a strange device and this caught the attention of the HR staff. Andre recalled that the mumblings were rather strange indeed and sounded like a mother's affectionate cooing mixed with an unnatural amount of technical jargon: \"Awww, good job. Now let's run the previous input again, darling. But this time with new ambient parameters. Now, energy data can be incredibly complex, so don't move around while mommy fine-tunes your sensory modules.\" \nAndre initially regarded this as Yvonne's personal quirks not uncommon amongst scientists. However, further contact and observations revealed that Yvonne was applying a unique and extremely advanced form of programming. The giant contraption literally \"heard\" everything she said and it was furnished with a stand-alone AI module to ensure that the machine could calibrate, correct, and update itself based on her verbal commands. \nSoon, the result of Yvonne's project was finally revealed. It was a machine the size of a family car that she named Trans-Æther Tranquilizer-Automata, or TA-TA for short. The AI module that obediently \"listened\" to Yvonne's words was also given a small display panel and a suite of emotes to respond to Yvonne's commands. \nAn excerpt from Andre's report to the HR Division reads: \"I don't know how many voice commands Yvonne had set up when making this, but it is obvious that she was very personally invested in her creation. This personal connection affected both Yvonne and TA-TA and we must evaluate the potential effects of the said connection.\" </>",

The Endfielders politely declined at first, but had a change of heart and asked: \"Can we?\" \nLifeng gave a toothy grin. \"Of course!\" \nEveryone knew at once that the lad would get along. \nThe operators gossiped that the Endministrator used some unconventional means to convince the lad to sign up with Endfield. The commitment exhibited by Lifeng made people think that the intern might have misunderstood Endfield Industries or the Endministrator's style of leadership. As an example, Lifeng was given the simple task of receiving a batch of goods arriving at the warehouse. The lad, for some reason, decided to clean up and organize the entire place. \"The warehouse was running out of room,\" the lad explained, \"So I did what I could to free up some space.\" \nThe Endfielder working the next shift was speechless. \"Maybe someone should tell him that this goes way beyond the warehouse receiving process.\" \n\"Erm... But it's pretty neat... Maybe we ... shouldn't?\" \nThough many have, out of friendliness, pointed out to Lifeng that he's doing way more than he should, the intern would just scratch his head. \"I left home and found a great place to learn and improve. This opportunity didn't come easily, so I should work hard and make the most out of it!\" \nA model Endfielder, purest of heart! \nOperator Lifeng would not agree to everything, of course. During an employee party, everyone (except Lifeng) unanimously agreed to order cystymilk for the legal minor. When Lifeng hurried over and joined the party, his face was down and he hardly talked. The lad only found the courage to speak when the party was winding down: \"I'll keep growing, you know... So you don't really have to order cystymilk for me.\" \nThe lad has the pride of a grown-up too! </>",

Also found the novel case of Oripathy that the Medical Department kept looking for. For the last 6 months, several Oripathy-positives in this town showed inexplicable symptoms that included mental disorders and strange behaviors. Their eyes were unfocused and blank. They had no will of their own. All of them kept hearing sounds and seeing things that did not exist. \nAUGUST 2 \nI convinced the local surgeon to diagnose the Oripathy-positives once more. Those who had chronic Oripathy for years exhibited typical symptoms and no mental problems. The opposite was true of those who contracted the disease recently. I believe that a deposit of anomalous Originium must be nearby. I must quickly locate this source of infection. \nAUGUST 7 \nI found an Originium vein deep in the forest. A sample was collected and delivered to Rhodes Island. We must ready ourselves for the worst. The anomalous mineral vein might have spread across a sizable region and the infection could be worse than we believe. \nNOTE (messily written): I dreamed of the strange sights again. Those soft and cryptic murmurs worry me...\nAUGUST 9 \nI made another strange finding. The locals worship ... or rather, worshiped fire. Frescoes and ritual implements found in the ruins north of the town suggest that the residents once venerated a Terran who wielded and controlled fire. The adherents of this religion regarded fire as a source of power for resisting the Blight. However, fewer and fewer people held on to this folk religion as years went by. The mayor of the town staunchly believed that the mental disorders amongst the Oripathy-positives were a direct consequence of the younger generation turning away from the faith. \nNOTE (obviously scribbled out and edited): The statue that served as the icon of worship felt oddly familiar. </>",

During incubation, the victim will not experience any discomfort and most of our diagnostic measures will fail to detect the particles as they encapsulate themselves with stable materials. When incubation ends, the encapsulated particles will detach, rupture, and release more Blight particles with higher levels of activity.

Zasso studied her reaction and chuckled. \n\n\"I can't imagine any form of life capable of surviving these long nights and frigid cold,\" she said softly. \n\n\"Nilla my child, this is exactly why this blade leaves no survivors,\" Zasso replied. \"It is the greatest invention of our age.\" \n\nElectrical currents hummed beneath the Originium. The arc shot out from the pommel, raced down the body of the blade, and gave the seething mineral glass its razor edge. \n\nThe blade slowly acquired a bluish hue as her crusade continued. Rumors say the blade drank the souls of its victims. \n\n\"But do the Aggeloi have souls?\" \n\n\"It might be your soul, Nilla. You are a smart, gentle child, but this is a weapon.\" \n\nThe sword has now been lost in battle. Perhaps it had been lost in countless occasions upon countless fields of war. History remembers none of its wielders, but the whistling songs sung by the blade always resonated with the ancient crystals that lay frozen in the deep ice caverns. ",

This may suggest that the number of fighting styles she had mastered far exceeded those that she listed in her file. \n\"Nevertheless, Chen remains remarkably dedicated to perfecting her fighting styles. Sparring seems to be her only pastime besides watching martial arts movies—and she has almost invited every operator who used the training gym to a friendly bout. Given her unique background and childhood training, few could hope to give her any useful advice nor learn anything useful from her. This, however, did not diminish her enthusiasm for sparring. \n\"Maybe Chen regards these 1v1 sparring sessions as a more useful form of socializing.

And before I forget, we don't grow rice on sand—OF COURSE I KNOW there's this sciency greenhouse in Wuling working on some special Xiranite growth mix, but that's like ... soilless farming ... right?\" \nChen's listeners often responded to her explanations with calls of disbelief. Nevertheless, insiders revealed that Chen single handedly corrected Hongshan stereotypes and fantasies held by many fellow Endfielders. \n\nAs for the reality of Hongshan— \n\"I don't know how to get started.

She appeared rather reluctant to become an Endfield operator. According to tradition, operators need to provide a codename in their registration form. Her pen hovered above the form for a while before scrawling the word: <i>Ember</i>. \nEmber's time with the Order of Steel Oath gave her a disciplined lifestyle and a committed sense of duty. Endfield's partnership with Ember was a case of exceptional success. She never questioned her mission assignments and carried them out in near-fanatical fashion as though she was trying to redeem herself of a burden. \nCertain voices within Endfield questioned if Operator Ember could ever adapt to the Endfield culture. A few days ago, an operator gave this feedback: \"Ember kept sleeping on the floor... Does she have something against our dorms?\" Another Endfielder also gave this observation: \"Her room is really empty. I thought she moved out and went somewhere pretty far away.\" \nOperator Ember was informed of her peer feedback. She gave a rather surprised look of a person caught unawares. After an awkward pause, she gave a somewhat embarrassed explanation: \"Some habits die hard. Beds in the south are just too soft. We also slept on the floor of our fortresses.\" \nSince then, Ember attempted to decorate her dorm room with personal belongings. \nA small, tattered leatherbound booklet was included amongst her personal crusading effects. It was obvious that Ember meticulously cared for this item as the title <i>Oaths</i> remained legible. The pages include these writings: \n<i>We swore the oath of suffering, for joyous indulgence shall be our undoing.</i></>",

During our conversation, she repeatedly inquired how my linguistics converter transformed sentience logic signals into digital code interpretable as audio wave outputs by my voice generator. In every occasion, I politely requested her to focus on the ongoing HR interview. Xaihi appeared rather disappointed and expressed her desire to install a duplicate set of my components into her physical body, her reasons being: 'This would improve my effectiveness of conversing with humans.' I pointed out that Xaihi has a complete complement of human speech organs with an oral communication performance that far exceeds my electromechanical voice generation suite. Xaihi, however, seemed to be unconvinced. \n\"Besides this minor interview incident, the general profile of Xaihi matches an individual capable of living with non-living constructs. This does not contradict her educational background with the Cabal of Tranquility, an organization that remained rather secretive during most of the last century. One thing to note is that the Facial Expression and Physiological Response Analyzer (FEPRA) of my sentience module failed to capture sufficient emotive changes or facial expression data from her.\" \n——Martin Marvin Malen, Assistant, HR Division, Endfield Industries</>",

These posters should be furnished with the photographs as well as common and regional names various food ingredients. Operators responsible for food purchases must use these reference posters to verify their purchase list. \nDa Pan gave the following reasons to support his proposal: \n\"After I started working here for three days, I told someone to get me some shanyao (HR translation: mountain yam) from the pantry, skin them, and soak them in cold water because I intend to make some Sucao Shanyao (HR translation: stir-fried mountain yam). Know what I got? A tub of potatoes! I had to change the dish to Suanla Tudousi (HR translation: spicy and sour potato shreds) for that night! \n\"And then during the second week, some girl told me she wanted some cauliflower and I made Ganguo Huacai (HR translation: wok-fried cauliflower) exactly as she wanted. When served, the girl refused to have a bite and angrily went to the kitchen. She had the audacity to point at a cabbage and told me *that* was the cauliflower she wanted. \n\"The worst thing happened 2 days ago. I made an entire steam trolley with over a dozen baskets of baozi (HR translation: stuffed Hongshan buns) and dim sum snacks. Some operators started calling my baozi as mantou, which has *NO* stuffing! Chen also tried explaining to the others that shuijian-bao (HR translation: pan-fried buns), guantang-bao (HR translation: typically large soup buns), and xiaolong-bao (HR translation: typically small soup buns served in bamboo baskets) aren't the same thing. But when Arclight insisted they are medium, large, and small and Avy still wanted to call them crispy, jiggly, and cutesy, the poor girl got so angry she almost started a fight. \n\"I have worked as a chief for years and I don't mind the hard work and heat. But I cannot stand it when people know nothing about food! That is a CRIME!\" </>",

The form of a weapon is a conclusive result of both traditions and experience. Nature has granted us intuitive senses to differentiate between things that work and things that don't. Elegance and harmony are the unspoken answers for perfection that we arrived at thanks to the countless years of our history and hard-earned experiences. \n\nAnd I must seize this bid just to prove this point. \n\nI got 9 ways to achieve the level of destruction desired by the client, but none of them should be used by a weapon of this size. \n\nI also heard that Henry decided to test out his flash-burn impulse technology. Laughable. The client specifically requested a sword, not a cannon with a hilt welded to it. \n\nWeapon performance failed to meet the desired specifications. \n\nHenry had a short discussion with me. His team was also out of ideas. I didn't know what the client might think if they saw this private meeting of weapon designers from 2 competing companies. \n\nTheir specifications were impossible. Why did the boss agree to take on this contract? \n\nEven if the dude took the sample prototype to HQ and wanted something with the exact same performance, he would just get another strange artifact unearthed by another bunch of weirdos. We now have more than reputation to worry about. These untested and strange devices pose a threat to our very lives. \n\nI received a flash of inspiration during shower that might just help us meet the minimum specs. I knew bathroom opera would work. \n\nA stack of 4 core armor slabs of armored vehicles? Hmph. My solution could go through that in a single slash. I doubt if RAYTHEAN has a better alternative. Physics is a hard science with hard limits. We may have our differences, but both of us should acknowledge this truth. \n\n  The Cabal of Tranquility re-activated the prototype. \n\nIt went through ... a stack of 16 armor slabs. The Cabal intends to run another test with a stack of 32 once emergency repairs for the ceiling is complete. \n\nThey even proposed a diagonal cut from corner to corner. \n\nMaybe I should talk to the boss about this.",

How vast is the distance from one heart to the next? \nEvery day spent working for the TGCC made Avy wonder if these people could ever hope to heal the cracks between them. \nThe Cartel smothers everything, including their own conscience, with cold hard cash. When Avy submitted her letter of resignation, her manager snickered: \"If you can't handle the weight on your conscience, you were never meant to be a messenger to begin with.\" \nThe manager then offered a rather substantial raise. Enough to pay for a penthouse with a nice view of the massive city. \"In any case, your skill set is a valuable asset to us,\" the manager said, \"Know that I don't make this offer to every employee, Avy.\" \n\nThe old postmaster and the only employee at a frontier mail depot could scarcely believe his eyes when Avy showed up with her resume. \n\"You're trying to pull my creaky legs? We can't afford someone like you.\" \nAvy smiled and said she would work pro bono. \"And I'm just looking for a change of pace.\" \nHer first job in the frontier came from a mining company. She was to deliver a letter to a late miner's wife. The hysterical woman chased Avy out of the worker shack while calling her a cursed bearer of lies. She conducted the final step of package delivery with a professional and mature smile on her face. After leaving the shack, Avy stood in the open wilderness and felt the cold biting winds. \nAvy submitted the completed job order at the punch register and received a tenth of her usual pay at the Band. Messenger compensations for frontier deliveries do not cover transit costs. Avy had to pull stuck vehicles from mucky roads and fight her way out of Landbreaker raiding parties. She kept her cool and her emotions flat throughout these ordeals. \nOne week later, she received a request for her presence at the shack of the late miner's wife. The widow was waiting by the porch and gripped Avy's hands tightly as she apologized for her emotional outburst during the delivery. \nWhy apologize? \nAvy was caught unawares but instantly regained her composure. The widow continued: \"I had to live with the sadness, Missus Messenger. But when I thought about your reliable smile, it gave me hope ... for the days to come.\" \nSo this is what it is ... the power held by the messengers... Avy thought to herself. </>",

Only a few would actually make this trip, and fewer still stood their ground after facing an actual Aggelos. Those who faced the Aggeloi and passed the Order of Steel Oath recruitment trials were rare gems instead. \nAzrila was one of those gems. Back then, the girl was barely half my height. Yet her deceptively frail frame contained a mysterious wrath that burned like raging flames and ignited our discerning gaze. And thus I agreed to take her in as a squire. \nAnd in this desolation of ice and snow she soldiered and squired, ever-burning and never failing her duties. \nI heard she was orphaned. Perhaps her parents were killed by the Aggeloi. \nThe Oathkeepers cared little about the backgrounds of their peers. Everyone was expected to fight and know who our enemies were. \nAnd Azrila spent whatever was left of her childhood at Order camps. The girl was a conflagration that ignited the entire battlefield. She made it to the finals of the Steel Oath Annual Tourney for 3 consecutive years, a feat that few could ever hope to achieve. Yet she remained passive and exhibited no joy when I praised her martial performance. \n\"I shall send them all to the Sanktum,\" she said. \nThe children born and raised in Talos-II would never learn that Angels and Sanktum used to carry beautiful meanings in times past. \nI asked Azrila if she wanted something else besides the champion's trophy. She thought for a while and gave me her answer: Lucion's Dagger. \nA slumbering artifact of glory long-gone, and an unusual choice. \"The dagger of loyalty to the Radiance now lies rusting in the gloom of the deepest night,\" I told her. \n\"I know,\" the girl answered, \"but still it points the way to the Radiant Path.\" \nWe thus made our way to the dust-ridden Old Arsenal of the Steel Oath. I took the dagger from the alcove and she gently received it with care. Light from the flaming torches on the wall glinted off the broken blade and danced in her eyes, like a sprinkling of ember that would splutter from stricken flint. Thus I named her Ignatia. </>",

In layman's terms, she can be rather 'provocative'. However, as our understanding of her personality profile deepens, my conclusion is that Avywenna deliberately chose to leave such impressions. She confessed: 'Those who have to make a living off the wildlands must look like a cranky stonespanker (translation: angry individual who readily engages in physical altercation), even if they're actually the nicest person around.' The Operator has exhibited child-like innocence, behaves like a professional mercenary, and negotiates with meticulously woven falsehoods.

We'll see you back at <i>Dijiang</i> soon. \n\n......\n\nWe met an ingenious designer at the TGCC and paid quite a steep price for his flagship design from RAYTHEAN Industries. This was meant to be your birthday present but we spent all our money during the auction and got in quite a bit of trouble for that. Our return to <i>Dijiang</i> will be slightly delayed but we'll be there to celebrate your birthday. Hope everything's well, sweetheart. And don't forget to give our kindest regards to Supervisor Perlica. \n\n......\n\nWe met Uncle Semyon and saw the handcannons you designed at Valley IV. It was so incredibly touching, but your old man spoiled the moment by ignoring me and \"stealing\" one of them without observing the proper protocol. I had to submit an application for him afterwards and wonder if you could apologize to Supervisor Perlica on his behalf. The bold design of the handcannon as well as your little innovation in the etched ammo took me by surprise... Something happened at Valley IV before we arrived and your Dad didn't contact me for hours after he ran off into the wildlands on his own. Don't worry. We'll be back onboard the ship to celebrate your birthday, sweetheart. \n\n......\n\nBy Talos, your handcannon is a work of wonder! \n\n......\n\nI contacted my old friends working at Hongshan Swordmancers.

He made a warming fire with dried grass, and was about to sleep when he saw a strange individual wearing jet-black clothing. The entity had no eyes nor mouth and its arm was joined to the mountain itself. My ancestor thus asked this strange entity: \"Sir, why is your arm joined with the rock?\" \n\nThe strange being replied: \"I once lived in Baizao. One day, I dreamed of a tiny figure dressed in yellow who stood in the middle of my palm and it asked me about the weight of human life. \n\n\"The tiny figure smiled and replied: 'And I am the Ruler of the Kingdom Upon the Palm.' \n\nAnd with that, the tiny figure disappeared and was never seen again. I did not want to overturn its kingdom, and thus I placed my hand upon this very place and did not move it for a century. As the years passed, a great mountain gradually rose from my palm. You are looking at it right now.\" \n\nMy ancestor was confused and asked: \"You are a kind and caring soul, but why allow yourself to be trapped here for so long? Your concerns are genuine and true, but why don't you severe your hand and be freed from this place?\" \n\nThe strange being mused: \"I do not know which weighs more—the Kingdom Upon the Palm, or the Palm Before My Wrist. Perhaps if I found the answer, I would be able to bear the weight of this mountain and travel with it. \n\nThe strange being then continued: \"Now, leave me in peace, and you shall have yours.\" With that, my ancestor fell asleep. Dawn broke, but the strange being was not seen again. \n\nI also heard about a herb that goes by the name <i>Zhenhuang</i>. The grass is mildly toxic and burning it generates hallucinogenic fumes. Perhaps this ancestor of mine had breathed in a whiff too many!",

None amongst the Zhayedan could stand against his ebony vortex. But by the time this oral tradition reached Orisha after multiple generations, nothing was left except for symbols more ambiguous than the tenets of the Fiannæ Circuit. Nevertheless, the people of the Circuit treated these symbols as the sparks of civilization. An individual who emulates their kern in action and speech would eventually don the kern's armor and become a kern themselves. \nThe HR operator asked, \"So ... what about your codename, Ekut? You left this part blank.\" \nOn the day after Ekut became a Scabhta, Sage Orisha took her to the wilderness. The girl was taught how to identify clouds by their shapes and to make out those that would bring storm and thunder. The sage sang a song that people used to sing when Kern Ebonrust lived: \"His raiment flapped in the furious wind, an arc of light to purging the corruption of sin.\" \n\"Call me Arclight,\" the new Endfield operator replied. </>",

Other tales spoke of the Pack as a <i>Famiglia</i> ruled by a Code far more unforgiving than any TGCC Practice, a vengeful organization that would tirelessly hunt down its traitors till the far corners of the world. \nWhatever the truth may be, the Pack was feared and respected by common folk who lived under their protection. Other Landbreaker clanns would acknowledge their presence and keep their distance. \nMerchants and business owners greatly admired these hunters who uphold the ancient codes and traditions, and would often seek their services. \nThese traveling merchants were always eager to share personal experiences from hiring a Wolf of the Pack or the stories of those who managed to do so. These tales were like the herbal mixes essential in every ciambotta vegetable stew, and spiced up the otherwise boring campfire nights out in the frontierlands. \n\"Never underestimate il Branco.\" Old Edward sat before the campfire and emphasized this again to his audience, \"They can be a lone wolf ... but they can also strike as a pack. For even a lone wolf is never truly alone.\" \n\"I thought the lone wolf left its pack already. That makes it alone, innit?\" The young messenger spoke out of turn. Old Edward shot him a vicious stare. \n\"No wolf is ever alone,\" the old man pried away the charred firewood with a poker. His eyes gazed into the far distance as he continued, \"if he yearns for his Pack, and is willing to pay the price... the Pack will always have a place for the prodigal wolf.\" \n\n——Unless, of course, he is a wolf no more.</>",

I hoped to drive you to your exam but my own job of monitoring the Lichao Blight got in the way. \n\nI believe you've already made all the essential preparations, but I must highlight the difficult challenge posed by the Originium Arts precision assessment. This is where most candidates fail, but you must succeed if you wish to join the Yinglung Special Operations Department. \n\nFor this assessment, you'll be using an Arts unit that the Hongshan Swordmancers specifically developed for Wuling. This unit includes Xiranite components whose circuitries change with the material. Wielding it would put your focus and all your senses to the test. \n\nYou probably know all of this by now. Youths of your age are calling this Arts unit as <i>Monaihe</i> and I can't help but agree. You won't find another Arts unit capable of eliciting more helpless frustration and anger from its wielder. The nickname even caught on with grown-ups like us. \n\nI'm afraid I can't tell you more about this puzzle-box of an Arts unit just to keep the assessment fair. Nevertheless, I have complete faith in you. Remember the wooden lock puzzles I bought you when you were a child? They kept you busy for a while but you always found a way to take them apart. <i>Monaihe</i> is the same thing. Overcome it like how you overcame those lock puzzles. Focus on the challenge and enjoy the process. \n\nGood luck out there.",

Never make a complicated situation more complicated than it should.\" \n\"Alright, then...\" Perlica spun her pen as she studied her notes.

This was just another of those occasions. \n\"These notes you're taking might be impractical for your situation.
